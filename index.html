The United States is the planet&#x2019;s number-one producer of trash. Each American throws out 4.5 pounds daily. But garbage is also a global problem; the Pacific Ocean is today six times more abundant with plastic waste than zooplankton. How did we end up with this much rubbish, and where does it all go? Journalist and filmmaker Heather Rogers answers these questions by taking readers on a grisly, oddly fascinating tour through the underworld of garbage.</p> <p>Said to &#x201c;read like a thriller&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>), <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> excavates the history of rubbish handling from the 1800s to the present, pinpointing the roots of today&#x2019;s waste-addicted society. With a &#x201c;lively authorial voice&#x201d; (<i>New York Press</i>), Rogers draws connections between modern industrial production, consumer culture, and our throwaway lifestyle. She also investigates controversial topics like the politics of recycling and the export of trash to poor countries, while offering a potent argument for change.</p> <br></p><p>Heather Rogers is a journalist and filmmaker. Her documentary film <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> (2002) screened in festivals around the globe. Her writing has appeared in <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Utne Reader</i>, <i>Z Magazine</i>, the <i>Brooklyn Rail</i>, <i>Punk Planet</i>, and <i>Art and Design</i>. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br>*Starred Review* America leads the world in garbage, and that is nothing to be proud of. A clear-thinking and peppery writer, Rogers presents a galvanizing expose of how we became the planet's trash monsters. Americans were ingeniously thrifty until industrialization ushered in consumer culture and the age of disposable goods and built-in obsolescence. But once the public was exhorted to buy stuff whether they needed it or not--and Rogers provides many eye-opening examples of corporate strategies and propaganda--new forms of garbage began to pile up and break down into toxic substances. Rogers details everything that is wrong with today's wasteful packaging, bogus recycling, and flawed landfills and incinerators. Here, too, is the inside story of the plastic revolution and the irresponsibly wasteful beverage market, the Mafia's involvement in commercial waste, and the illegal overseas shipping of garbage, especially toxic e-waste--trashed computers and cell phones. Rogers exhibits black-belt precision in her assault on American corporations that succeed in "greenwashing" the public while remaining "hell-bent on ever-expanding production no matter what the ecological toll." Set this beside Elizabeth Royte's <i>Garbage Land </i>(2005), and contemplate Rogers' dictum: garbage "never really goes away." <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

The expansionary trajectory of industrial civilization is colliding with non-negotiable natural limits. </p><p> Richard Heinberg&#x2019;s latest landmark work goes to the heart of the ongoing financial crisis, explaining how and why it occurred, and what we must do to avert the worst potential outcomes. Written in an engaging, highly readable style, it shows why growth is being blocked by three factors: </p><ul><li> Resource depletion </li><li> Environmental impacts </li><li> Crushing levels of debt </li></ul><p> These converging limits will force us to re-evaluate cherished economic theories and to reinvent money and commerce. </p><p><i> The End of Growth </i> describes what policy makers, communities, and families can do to build a new economy that operates within Earth&#x2019;s budget of energy and resources.

As he dies, his kingdom also dies. His armies suffer defeat, the young emigrate, the seasons change overnight, and his kingdom&#x2019;s borders shrink to the outline of his throne.

With anecdotes from his time spent at Keewaydin and stories from his life in the upper echelons of American business that illustrate the camp&#39;s continued influence, Eisner creates a touching and insightful portrait of his own coming-of-age, as well as a resounding declaration of summer camp as an invaluable national institution.</p><p>Michael D. Eisner is the chairman of Walt Disney Corp. and has worked variously as the President and COO of Paramount Pictures and Senior VP of ABC Entertainment.Disney's enfant terrible, Michael Eisner, will always be a loyal camper at Camp Keewaydin, deep in the woods of Vermont. This fond remembrance by the gruff-voiced entertainment powerhouse explains not only the origins of his hoarse vocal style (straining his voice during a camp trip) but also the core of his inner strength and sense of team dynamics. Now three generations of Eisners have attended the Vermont institution, testing their mettle on long canoe trips and in wholesome competition and bonding with other campers. A subplot details the experiences of two inner-city campers the Eisners sponsor at the camp. With earnest warmth and misty memories, Eisner shares what may well be a workable credo for many listeners.

Writing from his prison cell, he offered an&nbsp;astute new analysis of what is happening to the Kurdish people and future prospects for humanity.&nbsp;<i>The Sociology of Freedom</i> is the third volume of a five-volume work titled <i>The Manifesto of the Democratic Civilization</i>. The general aim of the earlier volumes was to clarify what power and capitalist modernity entailed. Here, ï¿½calan presents his thesis of the Democratic Civilization, based on his criticism of Capitalist Modernity. He advances what is the most radical, far-reaching definition of democracy today and argues that a democratic civilization, as an alternative system, already exists, though&nbsp;systemic power and knowledge structures&nbsp;do not allow it to be seen.

Fairbank and his wife, Wilma Fairbank, got their first impressions of Chinese life by living in Peking for four years in the early 1930s.

After he resumed teaching, his first book, The United States and China, in 1948 reflected his impressions of the revolutionary ferment among the Chinese people.

Luckily, I never let pride get in the way of my work. My current mission is personal: annihilate Mab Monroe, the Fire elemental who murdered my family. Which means protecting my identity, even if I have to conceal my powerful Stone and Ice magic when I need it most. To the public, I&#x2019;m Gin Blanco, owner of Ashland&#x2019;s best barbecue joint. To my friends, I&#x2019;m the Spider, retired assassin. I still do favors on the side. Like ridding a vampire friend of her oversized stalker&#x2014;Mab&#x2019;s right-hand goon who almost got me dead with his massive fists. At least irresistible Owen Grayson is on my side. The man knows too much about me, but I&#x2019;ll take my chances. Then there&#x2019;s Detective Bria Coolidge, one of Ashland&#x2019;s finest. Until recently, I thought my baby sister was dead. She probably thinks the same about me. Little does she know, I&#x2019;m a cold-blooded killer . . . who is about to save her life.</p><p>Jennifer Estep is a <i>New York Times </i>and <i>USA Today </i>bestselling author prowling the streets of her imagination in search of her next fantasy idea. <i>Spider&#x2019;s Bite, Web of Lies, Venom, Tangled Threads,</i> <i>Spider&#x2019;s Revenge, By a Thread, Widow&#x2019;s Web, Deadly Sting, Heart of Venom</i>, <i>The Spider, Poison Promise, Black Widow, Spider&#x2019;s Trap, Bitter Bite, Unraveled, </i>and <i>Snared, </i>along with the e-shorts <i>Thread of Death, Parlor Tricks, Kiss of Venom</i>, <i>Unwanted, </i>and<i> Nice Guys Bite</i> are the other works in her red-hot Elemental Assassin<b> </b>urban fantasy series.

That was me. Gin Blanco. Restaurant owner. Stone and Ice elemental. Former assassin. And all-around badass. Laid low by a microbe.<br><br>It had started as a small, ominous tickle in my throat three days ago. And now, well, it wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Watery eyes. Pale face. And a nose so red and bright even Rudolph would have been jealous. Ugh.<br><br>The only reason I&#x2019;d even crawled out of bed this evening was to come down to Ashland Community College and take the final for the classic literature class I was auditing. I&#x2019;d finished my essay on symbolism in <i>The Odyssey</i> ten minutes ago. Now I plodded across one of the grassy campus quads and feverishly dreamed of sinking back into my bed and not getting out of it for a week.<br><br>Just after seven on a cold, clear December night. This was the last day of finals for the semester, and the campus was largely deserted. Only a few lights burned in the windows of the kudzu-covered brick buildings that rose above my head. The stones whispered of formulas, theories, and knowledge. An old, sonorous, slightly pretentious sound that was decidedly at odds with the sinister shadows that blackened most of the quad. No one else was within sight. Which is probably why they decided to jump me here. Well, that and the fact that kidnapping me would be such a <i>bother.</i><br><br>One second I had my face buried in a tissue blowing my sore, drippy nose for the hundredth time today. The next, I looked up to find myself surrounded by three giants.<br><br>Oh, fuck.<br><br>I stopped, and they immediately closed ranks, forming a loose triangle of trouble around me. The giants were all around seven feet tall, with oversize, buglike eyes and fists almost as big as my head. One of them grinned at me and cracked his knuckles. Someone was anxious to get down to the business of beating me.<br><br>My gray eyes flicked to the leader of the group, who had taken up a position in front of me&#x2014;Elliot Slater. Slater was the tallest of the three giants, his enormous figure making even his flunkies seem small in comparison. He was almost as wide as he was tall, with a solid, muscled frame. Granite would be easier to break than his ribs. Slater&#x2019;s complexion was pale, bordering on albino, and almost seemed to glow in the faint light. His hazel eyes provided a bit of color in his chalky skin, although his thin, tousled thatch of blond hair did little to cover his large skull. A diamond in his pinkie ring sparkled like a star in the dark night.<br><br>Up until my retirement a few months ago, I&#x2019;d moonlighted as an assassin known as the Spider. Over the years, I&#x2019;d had plenty of dealings in the shady side of life, so I knew Slater by sight and reputation. On paper, Elliot Slater was a highly respected security consultant with his own platoon of giant bodyguards. In reality, Slater was the number-one enforcer for Mab Monroe, the Fire elemental who ran the Southern metropolis of Ashland like it was her own personal fiefdom. Slater stepped in and either cut off, took care of, or permanently disposed of any pesky problems Mab didn&#x2019;t feel like dealing with herself.<br><br>And tonight it looked like that problem was me.<br><br>Not surprising. A couple of weeks ago, I&#x2019;d stiffed someone during a party at Mab Monroe&#x2019;s mansion. Needless to say, the Fire elemental hadn&#x2019;t been too thrilled about one of her guests being murdered in her own home when she&#x2019;d been entertaining a few hundred of her closest business associates. I&#x2019;d gotten away with it so far, but I knew Mab was doing everything in her power to find the killer. To find <i>me.</i><br><br>I sniffled into my tissue. I wondered if Mab had figured out who I really was. If that was why Slater was here tonight&#x2014;<br><br>Elliot Slater looked over his broad shoulder. &#x201c;Is this her?&#x201d;<br><br>Slater slid to one side so another man, a much shorter human, could join the circle of giants surrounding me. Underneath his classic trench coat, the man wore a perfect black suit, and his polished wingtips gleamed like wet ink in the semidarkness. His thick mane of gunmetal gray hair resembled a heavy mantle of silver that had somehow been swirled and sculpted around his head. Too bad hate made his brown eyes look like congealed lumps of blood in his smooth, tight face.<br><br>I recognized him too. Jonah McAllister. On paper, McAllister was the city&#x2019;s premiere attorney, a charming, bellicose defense lawyer capable of getting the most vicious killer off scot-free&#x2014;for the right price. In reality, the slick attorney was another one of Mab Monroe&#x2019;s top goons, just like Elliot Slater was. Jonah McAllister was Mab&#x2019;s personal lawyer, responsible for burying her enemies in legal red tape instead of in the ground like Slater did.<br><br>McAllister&#x2019;s son, Jake, was the one I&#x2019;d murdered at Mab&#x2019;s party. The twentysomething, beefy frat boy had threatened to rape and murder me, among other things. I&#x2019;d considered killing him pest extermination more than anything else.<br><br>Elliot Slater and Jonah McAllister tag-teaming me. This night just kept getting better and better. I sniffled again. Really should have stayed home in bed.<br><br>Jonah McAllister regarded me with cold eyes. &#x201c;Oh, yes. That&#x2019;s her. The lovely Ms. Gin Blanco. The bitch who was giving my boy a hard time.&#x201d;<br><br>A hard time? I supposed so, if you thought turning him in to the cops for attempted robbery, breaking a plate full of food in his face, and ultimately stabbing Jake McAllister to death was a hard time. But I noticed that Jonah McAllister didn&#x2019;t say anything about me actually <i>killing</i> his son. Hmm. Looked like this was some sort of fishing expedition. I decided to play along&#x2014;for now.<br><br>&#x201c;What is this meeting all about?&#x201d; My voice came out somewhere between a whiny wheeze and a phlegmy rasp. &#x201c;Are you taking up Jake&#x2019;s bad habit of assaulting innocent people?&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah McAllister&#x2019;s face hardened at my insult. As much as it could, anyway. Despite his sixty-some years, McAllister&#x2019;s features were as smooth as polished marble, thanks to a vigorous regimen of expensive Air elemental facial treatments. &#x201c;I would hardly consider you innocent, Ms. Blanco. And you&#x2019;re the one who assaulted my precious boy first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your <i>precious boy</i> came into my restaurant, tried to rob me, and almost killed two of my customers with his Fire elemental magic.&#x201d; I spat out the words, along with some phlegm. &#x201c;All I did was defend myself. What does it matter now anyway? Your boy is dead because of some weird heart condition. At least, that&#x2019;s what was in the newspaper.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonah McAllister stared at me, trying to see if I knew more than I was letting on about his son&#x2019;s untimely demise. I used the lull to blow my nose&#x2014;again. Fucking microbes.<br><br>McAllister&#x2019;s mouth twisted with disgust at the sight and sound of my sniffles. Admittedly, it wasn&#x2019;t my most attractive moment. He jerked his head at Elliot Slater, who nodded back.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, Ms. Blanco,&#x201d; Slater drawled. &#x201c;The reason for this meeting is that Mr. McAllister thought you might have some information about his son&#x2019;s death. Jake did have a bit of a heart condition, but there were also some suspicious circumstances surrounding his passing. Happened a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d;<br><br>Suspicious circumstances? I assumed that was polite talk for a sucking stab wound to the chest. But I kept my face blank and ignorant.<br><br>&#x201c;Why would I know anything about Jake&#x2019;s death?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;The last time I saw the little punk was the day he brought his old man there down to the Pork Pit to threaten me into dropping the charges against him.&#x201d;<br><br>Lies, of course. I&#x2019;d run into Jake McAllister one more time after that&#x2014;at Mab Monroe&#x2019;s party. Even though I&#x2019;d been gussied up as a hooker, he&#x2019;d still recognized me. Since I&#x2019;d been there to kill someone else, I&#x2019;d lured sweet little Jakie into a bathroom, stabbed him to death, left his body in the bathtub, and washed the blood off my dress before going back out to the party. Nothing I hadn&#x2019;t done a hundred times before as the assassin the Spider. I certainly hadn&#x2019;t lost any sleep over it.<br><br>But right now, it looked like I might lose a whole lot more.<br><br>&#x201c;See, that&#x2019;s the problem. My good friend Jonah doesn&#x2019;t believe you. So he asked me and some of my boys to come down here and see if perhaps we could jog something free from your memory.&#x201d; Slater smiled. His lips drew back, giving me a glimpse of his pale pink gums. The giant&#x2019;s grin reminded me of a jack-o&#x2019;-lantern&#x2019;s gaping maw&#x2014;completely hollow. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to pay these sorts of visits to anyone Jake might have had a problem with. And your name was at the top of the list.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course it was. I was probably the only person in Ashland who&#x2019;d ever dared to stand up to Jake McAllister. Now his daddy was going to make me pay for it.<br><br>Slater took off his suit jacket, handed it to Jonah McAllister, and started rolling up his shirtsleeves.<br><br>I sniffled, blew my nose again, and considered the situation. Four-on-one odds were never terrific, especially since three of the four men were giants. The oversize goons could be hard to bring down, even for a former assassin like me. None of the giants showed any obvious elemental abilities, like letting flames flicker on their clenched fists or forming Ice daggers with their bare hands. But that didn&#x2019;t mean they didn&#x2019;t have magic. Which would make them doubly hard to get rid of.<br><br>Still, if I hadn&#x2019;t had the flu, I might have considered killing them&#x2014;or at least cutting down a couple so I could run away. Although I&#x2019;d dragged myself out of bed this evening, I&#x2019;d grabbed my silverstone knives on the way out the door. Five of them. Two tucked up my sleeves. One nestled in the small of my back. Two more in the sides of my boots. Never left home without them.<br><br>Of course, being an elemental myself I didn&#x2019;t really need my knives to kill. I could just use my magic to take down the giants. My Stone power was so strong that I could do practically anything I wanted to with the element. Like make bricks fly out of the wall of one of the surrounding buildings and use them to brain the giants in their melon-size heads. <i>Splat, splat, splat.</i> It&#x2019;d be easier than using an Uzi. Hell, if I really wanted to show off, I could just crumble all four of the buildings that ringed the quad down on top of them.<br><br>I was also one of the rare elementals who could control more than one element. Stone and Ice, in my case. Until recently, my Ice magic had been far weaker than my Stone power. But thanks to a series of traumatic events, I could do much more with it now. Like create a wall of Ice knives to fling at the men. I&#x2019;d sliced through a dwarf&#x2019;s skin doing just that. Giants weren&#x2019;t quite as tough as dwarves, at least when it came to cutting into them. Even if they did have more blood to spare than their shorter compatriots.<br><br>But the odds or how to go about killing the giants wasn&#x2019;t what was holding me back. Not really. It was the consequences; what would happen afterward when their boss, Mab Monroe, got involved.<br><br>Seventeen years ago, Mab Monroe had used her elemental Fire magic to kill my mother and older sister, a fact I&#x2019;d only recently learned. She&#x2019;d also tortured me, using her magic to superheat and burn a spider rune medallion into my palms. I was planning to deal with Mab myself after I figured out a few things, like why she&#x2019;d murdered my family in the first place and where my long-lost baby sister, Bria, was now.<br><br>Taking care of Jonah McAllister and the rest of his hired help tonight would definitely tip my hand and draw even more of Mab&#x2019;s attention my way. I didn&#x2019;t want Mab and her minions to realize that I had any elemental magic. To suspect that I was anything more than the simple restaurant owner Jonah McAllister wanted dead for tattling on his son to the cops. At least, not before I killed her for what she&#x2019;d done to me.<br><br>All that left me with only one option tonight&#x2014;I was going to have to let the giants hurt me, beat me. That was the only way I could keep my cover identity as Gin Blanco safe, along with who I really was, Genevieve Snow.<br><br>Fuck. This was going to hurt.<br><br>Elliot Slater finished rolling up his sleeves. &#x201c;Are you sure you don&#x2019;t have anything to tell us, Ms. Blanco?&#x201d;<br><br>I sighed and shook my head. &#x201c;I told you before. I don&#x2019;t know anything about Jake McAllister&#x2019;s death except what I read in the newspaper.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that,&#x201d; Slater murmured.<br><br>The giant stepped forward and flexed his fingers, ready to get on with things. Time for me to put on a little show. I widened my eyes, as though it had just sunk into my flu-addled brain what Elliot Slater was planning to do to me. I let out a phlegmy scream and turned to run, as though I&#x2019;d forgotten all about the two giants standing behind me. I ran right into them, of course, and they reached for me. Even though I had no real intention of trying to break free, I still struggled to keep up appearances. Yelling, flailing, kicking out with my legs.<br><br>While I fought with the bigger, heavier men, I managed to discreetly slip the two silverstone knives that I had up my sleeves into the pockets of my jacket. I didn&#x2019;t want the giants to feel the weapons when they finally latched onto me. Most innocent women didn&#x2019;t go around wearing five knives on them, and my being so heavily armed would be the final nail in my coffin as far as Jonah McAllister was concerned about my involvement in his son&#x2019;s death.<br><br>The two giants laughed at me and my weak, exaggerated blows. After a minute of struggling, they seized my upper arms and turned me around to face Elliot Slater once more.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s when the fun really started.<br><br>Slater snapped his hand up and slammed his fist into my face. Bastard was quick, I&#x2019;d give him that. I hadn&#x2019;t braced myself for the blow, and I jerked back in the giants&#x2019; arms. The force almost tore me out of their grasp. Pain exploded like dynamite in my jaw.<br><br>But Slater didn&#x2019;t stop there. He spent the next two minutes beating me. One punch broke my drippy nose. Another cracked two of my ribs. And I didn&#x2019;t even want to think about the internal bleeding or what my face looked like at this point. <i>Thud, thud, thud.</i> I might as well have been a piece of meat the giant was tenderizing for dinner. Every part of me hurt and burned and throbbed and pulsed with pain.<br><br>And he laughed the whole time. Low, soft, chuckling laughs that made my skin crawl. Elliot Slater enjoyed hurting people. Really enjoyed it. His hard-on bulged against the zipper on his black pants.<br><br>Slater hit me again and stepped back. By this point, I hung limp between the two giants, all pretense of being tough and strong long gone. I just wanted this to be over with.<br><br>A hand grabbed my chin and forced my face up. I stared into Slater&#x2019;s hazel eyes. At least, I tried to. White starbursts kept exploding over and over in my field of vision, making it hard to focus. The light show was better than fireworks on the Fourth of July.<br><br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Elliot rumbled. &#x201c;Do you want to reconsider what you know about Jake McAllister&#x2019;s death? Maybe you have something new to add?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything about Jake&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; I mumbled through a mouthful of loose teeth. Blood spewed out of my split lips and cascaded down my navy fleece jacket. &#x201c;I swear.&#x201d; I made my voice as low, weak, and whipped as I could.<br><br>Jonah McAllister stepped forward and peered at me. Malicious glee shimmered in his brown gaze. &#x201c;Keep hitting her. I want the bitch to suffer.&#x201d;<br><br>Elliot Slater nodded and stepped back.<br><br>The giant spent another two minutes hitting me. More pain, more blood, more cracked ribs. As I coughed up another mouthful of coppery blood, it dawned on me that Slater just mi...</p><h2>Little Book Of The Dawn Chorus</h2><p>From a review in the Times Literary Supplement ...The Little Book of the Dawn Chorus is a sound book of genuine charm, whose attractiveness persists well beyond the novelty of pushing the buttons.

Industrial agriculture has also co-opted the term for marketing purposes without implementing better practices. Stephanie Anderson&nbsp;argues that&nbsp;in order to provide nutrient-rich food and fight climate change, we need to move beyond sustainable to regenerative agriculture, a practice that is highly tailored to local environments and renews resources.<br><br> In <i>One Size Fits None&nbsp;</i>Anderson follows&nbsp;diverse farmers across the United States:&nbsp;a South Dakota&nbsp;bison&nbsp;rancher who provides an alternative to the industrial feedlot; an organic vegetable farmer in Florida who&nbsp;harvests&nbsp;microgreens;&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Mexico super-small farmer who revitalizes communities; and a North Dakota midsize farmer who combines livestock and grain farming to convert expensive farmland back to native prairie. The use of these nontraditional agricultural techniques show how varied operations can give back to the earth rather than degrade it.

The land that lies flat on its back for kilometre after relentless kilometre. The black roads that run across it in different directions, slicing through one-street platteland towns. The cosmos flowers that form a guard of honour for the lone motorist. White, pink and purple petals. The sunflower fields that stretch as far as the eye can see. The land that is awash with yellowness. And the brownness of the qokwa grass.<br>Colour explodes. Green, yellow, red and blue. Sleepy-eyed women are walking among sunflowers. Naked women are chasing white doves among sunflowers. True atonement of rhythm and line. A boy is riding a donkey backwards among sunflowers. The ground is red. The sky is blue. The boy is red. The faces of the women are blue. Their hats are yellow and their dresses are blue. Women are harvesting wheat. Or they are cutting the qokwa grass that grows near the fields along the road, and is used for thatching houses. Big-breasted figures tower over the reapers, their ghostly faces showing only displeasure.<br>People without feet and toes&#x2014;all of them.<br>These things leap at us in broad strokes. Just as they leapt at Popi twenty-five years ago. Only then the strokes were simple and naï¿½ve. Just a black outline of figures with brown or green oil paint rubbed over them. Men in blankets and conical Basotho hats pushing a cart that is drawn by a donkey. Topless women dancing in thethana skirts. Big hands and big breasts.<br>That is one thing that has not changed, for Father Frans Claer-hout is still a great admirer of big hands and big breasts. He is, after all, still the same trinity: man, priest and artist. The threeness that has tamed the open skies, the vastness and the loneliness of the Free State.<br>Twenty-five years ago Popi peered from her mother&#x2019;s back at the white man as he warmly and masterfully daubed his broad strokes. At five she was precocious enough to wonder why the houses were all so skewed. And crowded together. She thought she could draw better houses. Her people, those she sketched on the sand in the backyard of her township home, were not distorted like the priest&#x2019;s. They were matchstick figures with big heads and spiky hair. But they were not distorted. Yet his very elongated people overwhelmed her with joy. She saw herself jumping down from her mother&#x2019;s back and walking into the canvas, joining the distorted people in their daily chores. They filled her with excitement in their ordinariness.<br>&#x201c;Popi, we must go now,&#x201d; her mother said.<br>&#x201c;Awu, Niki, I am still watching,&#x201d; appealed Popi. She always called her mother by the name that everyone else in the township used.<br>&#x201c;The Father has no use for me,&#x201d; said Niki as she walked out of the gate of the mission station. Popi was sulking on her mother&#x2019;s back. She had wanted to stay with the distorted people in their skewed houses.<br>&#x201c;We cannot waste time with your silliness,&#x201d; said Niki.<br>She had a long way to go. She was going to hitch-hike all the way back to the black township of Mahlatswetsa in Excelsior, thirty kilometres from the Roman Catholic mission in Thaba Nchu. Traffic was sparse on these roads. She knew that she would have to walk for miles before a truck would stop to give her a lift. Truck-drivers were really the only people who felt sorry for hitchhikers.<br>But trucks were few and far between on these provincial roads. She would have to walk for miles with only cosmos, the qokwa grass and sunflowers for company. Popi would be fast asleep on her back.<br>Although her visit to Thaba Nchu had not been a success, she was grateful that the priest had given her a few coins for her trouble. But she was disappointed that he had no use for her. She had heard from the women of his congregation that he painted naked women. In all the neighbouring townships and villages, women walked out of their skewed houses to pose in the nude for him. He paid his models well. Niki had hoped that she would also be able to pose for him.<br>But the priest had no need of a model. He was not in his nudes-painting mode. He had a few canvases of distorted people and skewed houses and donkeys and sunflowers to complete. Then, in a few weeks&#x2019; time, he would be painting the madonna subject. If Niki and Popi could come back then, he certainly would use them as models.<br>The priest was captivated by Popi. He loved all children. Even those who were emaciated and unkempt. Though Popi stayed on Niki&#x2019;s back all the time they were in his studio, he played with her, making all sorts of funny faces. Then he tore out a page from a magazine and shaped her a donkey. He gave it to her and pranced around the room, braying like a donkey. The stocky trinity with his broad face and snow-white mane brayed and brayed, and Popi laughed and laughed.<br>All this time Niki was nervous. She knew that the priest must have been wondering why Popi was so different from other children. Why she was so light in complexion. Why her eyes were blue, and why she had flowing locks.<br>We who know the story of Excelsior do not wonder.<br>As Niki trudged the black road until she became one with it, Popi&#x2019;s mind wandered back to the man who loved women, donkeys and sunflowers. And to his creations.<br>Woman and girl melted into God&#x2019;s own canvas.</p></p><h2>Land Of The Seven Rivers</h2><p>Did ancient India witness the Great Flood?

Other apparent suicides are cropping up, and they all have a connection to Elf's Grotto, a nearly bottomless network of flooded quarries just outside the city. Caffery begins to suspect a shadowy and sinister predator, someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014; that can disappear into darkness and slip into houses unseen.

Not wanting to lose the impatient reader, writers toss in everything but the kitchen sink. That is more or less what happens in Mo Hayder's "Skin," which kept me baffled much of the way. The novel is set in and around Bristol, England, and features Detective Inspector Jack Caffery and police Sgt. Phoebe (Flea) Marley, who were introduced in Hayder's earlier novel "Ritual." There is a hint of sexual attraction between the two, although Caffery claims to have sworn off women after several failed relationships. The first time Caffery and Marley meet in this novel, we're told that he "glanced at her breasts," whereupon this exchange follows: "I saw that." "Couldn't help myself. Sorry." "You're my senior officer. You're not supposed to look at me like that." It turns out that Marley was just having fun: "She liked the way Caffery had looked at her breasts. As if the T-shirt wasn't even there." There isn't much time for this sort of banter, however, because a bewildering number of bodies starts piling up and demanding our heroes' full attention. Marley is a police diver, and in an opening scene we see her in a flooded limestone quarry, diving deeper than she's supposed to, not finding a corpse but glimpsing something dark, the size of a big turtle, but with human feet. Both she and Caffery, it seems, think there is a "Tokoloshe" in the area, a creature out of African witchcraft. We see Caffery watching a video of a man being decapitated with a hacksaw, apparently by people who can sell the head for medicinal uses. We accompany Caffery as he talks with a mysterious figure called the Walking Man, who may or may not be human. We learn that a young woman named Misty Kitson is missing. Two other young women are found dead, apparent suicides. Soon, however, Caffery suspects that both were murdered. Marley has troubles closer to home. One day she notices a smell in the back of her car, opens the trunk and finds Kitson's body. It seems that Marley's worthless brother, having borrowed her car, accidentally ran down Kitson and inexplicably brought the corpse home. Against her better judgment, Marley decides to help her brother avoid punishment. Her reward: Her brother and his nasty wife concoct a story that will put the blame on Marley. Trying to prove her innocence, Marley encounters a woman who crusades to protect wildlife from motorists and is soon blackmailing the bedeviled police diver. Meanwhile, Caffery is investigating the possible murder victims. One of them left her husband, collected sex toys and seems to have been blackmailing someone before her death. Caffery's inquiries about another victim, a nurse, take him closer to the serial killer he believes to be at large, and when he finally confronts the killer, "Skin" becomes focused and suspenseful. But even then we have a letdown. Caffery gets out of a tight spot from which there is no obvious escape -- not due to his own cleverness but by something close to a miracle. One can only hope that further outings by Caffery and Marley will be less murky and far-fetched than this one. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2010, The Washington Post.

Rich in historical detail and bursting with bejeweled putrescence, Gabrielle Wittkop's chilling memento mori eschews the murder mystery in which it is garbed for a scintillating depiction of physical, moral, societal and institutional corruption, in which the author plays the role of puppeteer--"present, masked as convention dictates, while in a Venice on the brink of downfall, women gorged with venom burst like wineskins."<br><br>Self-styled heir to the Marquis de Sade, <b>Gabrielle Wittkop</b> (1920-2002) was a French author who wrote a remarkable series of novels and travelogues, all laced with sardonic humor and dark sexuality, with recurrent themes of death, disease and decrepitude. After meeting Justus Wittkop, a German deserter, in Paris under the Occupation, she hid him from the Nazis and then married him after the war, in what she described as an "intellectual alliance," given he was homosexual. He would commit suicide in 1986, with her approval, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's.

He was the author of several books, including <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and <i>Awakening of the Watchers</i>.Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was born in Great Britain and raised in London. Having wended his way through an English public school education and then seven years further study at college, he qualified as an architect. In the late 70s, Timothy began a systematic exploration of out-of-body states. This led to experiments in telepathic communication with dolphins and an open invitation to contact with nonphysical beings that continues to this day. During this time, he was also running his own business in New York City, marketing a system he had co-devised for storing and filing color photographs. He retired from the business community in 1981 and turned full time to his creative endeavors. As a musician, Timothy made several tapes of what he called "Bozon Music"--a True Age improvisational jazz, shamanic music of the heart--as well as a series of guided visualization and meditation tapes. Also an artist, he worked on a virtually endless progression of drawings of sacred landscape. It was what brought him most joy. Timothy traveled frequently to give lectures and seminars or to investigate sites and locations for his drawings. He is the author of <i>Ask Your Angels: A Practical Guide to Working with the Messengers of Heaven to Empower and Enrich Your Life</i>, <i>Dolphins, ETs &amp; Angels</i>, the Rebel Angels series of books featured below, and a co-author of <i>Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences: Angels, Aliens, Dolphins &amp; Shamans</i>.</p><h2>Last Seen Wearing (Inspector Morse Mysteries)</h2><p>Last Seen Wearing</p><p>"Morse is a thoroughly convincing detective, and a very humane one, too." <br>--The New York Times Book Review <p><br>Valerie Taylor has been missing since she was a sexy seventeen, more than two years ago.

Susan Wittig Albert is the author of the China Bayles mysteries <b>Thyme of Death, Witch's Bane, Hangman's Root, Rosemary Remembered, Rueful Death, Love Lies Bleeding, Chile Death, Lavender Lies</b>, <b>Mistletoe Man</b>, and <b>Bloodroot</b>. Bill Albert is the coauthor, with his wife, of more than sixty novels for young adults. They live in the Texas hill country.Paige's ninth Victorian mystery (after 2002's Death at Dartmoor) enmeshes married sleuths Lord Charles and Kate Sheridan yet again in royal intrigue and scandal, but with less success than usual. The Sheridans' holiday is interrupted by a summons from Edward VII to investigate strange occurrences at legendary Glamis Castle. The old story of the Monster of Glamis-a half-man, half-monster rumored to be a deformed scion of a noble family-gains new life when the castle's labyrinthine quarters are used to conceal the presence of Lord Osborne, who lives in isolation, tended to by a small staff of servants. Osborne's disappearance, which coincides with the brutal slaughter of a housemaid, proves worthy of the king's attention when the Sheridans learn that the victim's throat was slit in a manner consistent with the crimes of Jack the Ripper-and that Osborne is actually the king's eldest son, Edward, duke of Clarence, himself a one-time Ripper suspect, whose death was announced by Buckingham Palace a decade earlier. Although the Sheridans "solved" the Ripper murders in the earlier Death at Whitechapel, they can't eliminate the duke from suspicion. Their inquiry takes place amid increasing British tensions with imperial Germany, which adds a potential espionage angle to the murder. While the book is a quick read, there's little suspense or deduction, and the pleasant if underdeveloped main characters don't do enough to hold the reader's attention.and Susan Albert Wittig, the latter author of Indigo Dying and other titles in her China Bayles detective series.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Making Marvels: Science and Splendor at the Courts of Europe</h2><p><b>Innovation, technology, and spectacle combine in wondrous works of decorative art and furniture that embody the splendor and luxury of the royal courts of Europe</b><br><br> At once beautiful works of art and technological wonders, the objects featured in <i>Making Marvels</i> demonstrate how European royalty from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment signaled their status through their collections of ingeniously crafted inventions.

But Chrï¿½tien never finished his poem, leaving an unresolved story and an incomplete picture of the Grail. It was, however, far too attractive an idea to leave. Not only did it inspire quite separate works; his own unfinished poem was continued and finally completed by no fewer than four other writers. The Complete Story of the Grail is the first ever translation of the whole of the rich and compelling body of tales contained in Chrï¿½tien's poem and its four Continuations, which are finally attracting the scholarly attention they deserve. Besides Chrï¿½tien's original text, there are the anonymous First Continuation (translated here in its fullest version), the Second Continuation attributed to Wauchier de Denain, and the intriguing Third and Fourth Continuations - probably written simultaneously, with no knowledge of each other's work - by Manessier and Gerbert de Montreuil. Two other poets were drawn to create preludes explaining the background to Chrï¿½tien's story, and translated here also are their works: The Elucidation Prologue and Bliocadran. Only in this, The Story of the Grail's complete form, can the reader appreciate the narrative skill and invention of the medieval poets and their surprising responses to Chrï¿½tien's theme - not least their crucial focus on the knight as a crusader. Equally, Chrï¿½tien's original poem was almost always copied in conjunction with one or more of the Continuations, so this translation represents how most medieval readers would have encountered it. Nigel Bryant's previous translations from Medieval French include Perlesvaus - the High Book of the Grail, Robert de Boron's trilogy Merlin and the Grail, the Medieval Romance of Alexander, The True Chronicles of Jean le Bel and Perceforest.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>IntroductionChrï¿½tien de Troyes: PercevalThe First ContinuationThe Second ContinuationGerbert's ContinuationThe Third ContinuationAppendix 1: The Elucidation PrologueAppendix 2: BliocadranAppendix 3: Independent conclusion to the Second Continuation in the Bern manuscript [Burgerbibliothek 113]</p><p>Nigel Bryant was head of drama at Marlborough College.<br><br>Bryant&#39;s translations are very readable. FABULA This fine edition of the Grail story surrenders many treasures to a close read. Bryant capsulizes the seminal Chrï¿½tien version and the continuations in the introductory section, providing a helpful guide through the nearly six hundred pages that follow. COMITATUS Nigel Bryant&#39;s translation is highly reliable, engaging, and as lively as he can make it (his stint as Head of Drama at Marlborough College has served him well). . . . This new and Complete Story of the Grail offers a fresh translation with complete texts for all four continuations, as well as two prequels, along with more supporting apparatus to guide a twenty-first-century public. THE MEDIEVAL REVIEW This book makes a significant contribution to Arthurian studies. . . . Bryant should again be commended for his ability to bring that which was distant closer and make it just as compelling. Highly recommended. CHOICE</p><h2>A Place for Weakness: Preparing Yourself for Suffering</h2><p><p>In a world of hype, we may buy into the idea that, through Jesus, we&#x2019;ll be healthier and wealthier as well as wiser. So what happens when we become ill, or depressed, or bankrupt? Did we do something wrong? Has God abandoned us? As a child, Michael Horton would run up the down escalator, trying to beat it to the top. As Christians, he notes, we sometimes seek God the same way, believing we can climb to him under our own steam. We can&#x2019;t, which is why we are blessed that Jesus descends to us, especially during times of trial. In A Place for Weakness, formerly titled Too Good to Be True, Horton exposes the pop culture that sells Jesus like a product for health and happiness and reminds us that our lives often lead us on difficult routes we must follow by faith. This book offers a series of powerful readings that demonstrate how, through every type of earthly difficulty, our Father keeps his promises from Scripture and works all things together for our good.</p></p><p><p>Michael Horton (PhD) is Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics at Westminster Seminary in&nbsp;California. Author of many books, including&nbsp;<em>The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way,&nbsp;</em>he also hosts the <em>White Horse Inn</em> radio program. He lives with his wife, Lisa, and four children in Escondido, California.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>I felt as if I were a willful teenager again, with my father shaking me by the shoulders to bring me to my senses. Only now, he could not grab me. He could not even speak to me, although he desperately mumbled strange sounds. All that was left of the man were his eyes, pounding against my heart with their steely gray intensity. As everyone who knew him even casually could attest, my father had eyes that laughed before the rest of his face could catch up. Some of us, especially his children, knew that, on those rare occasions when his temper flared, it happened first in his eyes. With a mere glance, he could nip horseplay in the bud at the dinner table. Now those eyes were almost always reporting an emotion we had never seen in our dad. The one for whom the glass was always half full, who always landed on his feet in every circumstance, was more terrified of waking than of dying. Have you ever seen someone wail without actually being able to articulate a cry, his heaving chest and terrified visage giving the secret away? Larger than life since my childhood, this great man was now as helpless as an infant and more pitiful than any life I had ever known, his gaunt flesh wasting and yellowing with every passing week. At the age of seventy-eight, James Horton had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that required immediate surgery. At first, a shunt released some of the fluid on his brain, but a further surgery was necessary to excise the rapidly growing lump before it interrupted vital brain functions. This surgery failed, and before long we realized that my father would not recover. He lived for nearly a year, however, almost paralyzed from head to toe. Since even his face had lost muscular control, his eyelids drooped, exposing their red interior. It was as if his whole face had melted like wax, and we could hardly recognize him --- except for the eyes, which were always filled with emotion, usually unspeakable pain. But occasionally, and more frequently toward the end, they evidenced hope and a confidence that came from another place. We prayed for weeks that the Lord would take him home. We would place our son, just a few months old, in his namesake&#39;s listless arms and watch my dad&#39;s heaving chest signal his delight. Even then, it was always a bittersweet visit for my father, and for us. The Gibraltar of the family, my mother, fussed over his bedside, nervously fluffing his pillows at fifteen-minute intervals, ensuring that the intravenous fluids were properly calculated, and organizing edifying visits from friends and children from church. In between, she read quietly in her chair while holding Dad&#39;s hand. For years, I had witnessed the remarkable care that these two people provided in our home, first to their own parents and then to fifteen elderly folks in our residential care home as I was growing up. But now she was caring for her best friend, and there was almost nothing she could do for him but fluff his pillows --- and try to hide her own daily grief. Although my mom always looked ten years younger than her actual age, these months acted like time-lapse photography, working my father&#39;s pain into her own face and wearing her body down. A Second Blow Then, just two months before my father&#39;s death, Mom suffered a massive stroke while I was driving her from her sister&#39;s funeral, where she had delivered a moving eulogy. This strong and compassionate woman who had given her life to disadvantaged city kids and abandoned seniors was now herself dependent on others. I recalled a couple of times in the past when my parents had mentioned their worst fears about old age. For my dad, a debilitating disease would be the most horrible way of death, he said; for my mom, it was being a burden --- and from their caregiving experience they knew both well. In my darker moments, I wondered why God would allow them to experience their worst scenarios in the last act of their play, especially when they had done so much for so many others. They had moved close to Lisa and me in our first year of marriage to be of help when they learned of our first pregnancy. Always running to the side of those who needed a strong arm, my mom was now partially paralyzed and disabled, while my dad was succumbing to an agonizing death. I told God that it all seemed too calculated, that he seemed all too real, too involved, too present in our lives, especially my parents&#39;, as if he had cruelly dished out the very end that each most feared. Shouldn&#39;t people whose lives were all about giving to others, especially to the elderly, have a break when it comes to how they leave this life? It seemed to challenge the whole &#39;reap what you sow&#39; principle: does this apply only when people deserve bad and not when they deserve good? My wife, recovering from several especially difficult miscarriages, found that her visits to my dad&#39;s bedside only aggravated her questions about God&#39;s goodness. It was strange to see her go through this. After all, Lisa was a Bible study teacher who devoured pretty deep theology books. Now it was all being put to the test of real life. I had experienced death up close in our home growing up, not only with my grandparents but also with the adopted &#39;grandparents&#39; in our home for the elderly. Still, Lisa and I both struggled with the usual doubts. People suffer and even die from natural causes every day, we tried to tell ourselves. Furthermore, old people eventually die. We all die. This doesn&#39;t mitigate the tragedy, but its inevitability and universality at least prepare us for the fact. But why do some people suffer so much in their death? Why is it often so slow and painful? Is death itself not horrible enough that we also have to fear dying --- a wasting and withering that threatens our cherished expectations of a good and orderly providence? Just to look at my father over the course of those ghastly months, those long and torturous weeks, was to face the most serious, existential, concrete challenges to our deeply held Christian convictions.</p><h2>Southern Politics in State and Nation</h2><p>More than thirty years after its original publication, V.

Like Atlas, who bears Earth on his shoulders, Rich bears--and wields--an enormous political consciousness. These poems find her struggling to say what is honest and true, resisting easy answers, having the ambition to risk everything; these are the energies for which her readers return. For example, after deriding as solipsistic the poetry of Richard Hugo, she writes: <blockquote> I wonder if this is a white man's madness.<br> I honor your truth and refuse to leave it at that.<br> What have I learned from stories of the hunt, of lonely men in gangs?<br> But there were other stories...<br> </blockquote> Rich knows that mere political poetry has a quick expiration date. Her genius enables her to speak to the moment and to posterity simultaneously. "Catch if you can your country's moment, begin / where any calendar's ripped-off: Appomattox / Wounded Knee, Los Alamos / Selma, the last airlift from Saigon," she exhorts at one point, tuning the present to its history like Muriel Rukeyser or Ezra Pound. Early in the book Rich praises "those needed to teach, advise, persuade, weigh arguments ... the meticulous delicate work of reaching the heart of the desperate woman, the desperate man / --never-to-be-finished, still unbegun work of repair," but wonders who will continue this work in the America she has witnessed. "It cannot be done without them / and where are they now?" With this, her 21st book, her echo returns the answer. <i>--Edward Skoog</i>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals.

Move for me, baby."<br><br>What the hell? He had <i>not</i> gone to bed with a woman, so he shouldn't be hearing a husky, seductive voice in his ear. He knew he was in his bedroom at the farm, but, more important, he knew he was alone.<br><br>"Just a little bit more, sweetie."<br><br>Robbie sat bolt upright in bed and tried to see through the darkness. Nothing. No woman. Yet her voice had been quite distinct -- and soft and sexy and close.<br><br>"Come on," she whispered with fading patience. "I've got to get going. Oh, for God's sakes, just move!"<br><br>At the squawking of several disgruntled hens, Robbie snapped his head toward the baby monitor on his nightstand.

If he hadn't just heard her voice on the monitor, he would swear his thief was a kid. She looked like a child, squatting beside a backpack as she carefully placed her stolen breakfast in it.<br><br>She spotted him when he stepped off the porch.<br><br>She dropped two of the eggs when she stood with a startled squeak, swung the pack onto her back, and bolted for the pasture.<br><br>"Hey!

Then he'd find out who she was and what she was doing stealing his eggs.<br><br>Robbie's smile was gone a little over a mile later. She was getting away! Rasping for breath through gritted teeth, Robbie forced his legs to move faster. He'd arrogantly told his boys that he could catch a simple egg thief, and "No, thank you," he didn't need their adolescent help. He was not about to let last night's bragging to them turn into hoots of laughter this morning.<br><br>Robbie chased the woman for nearly two miles before he finally realized he wasn't going to catch her. The long-legged little cat had left the pasture, sprinted down the gully and over the knoll, and disappeared into the thick forest of TarStone Mountain.<br><br>Dammit!

Robbie used up most of his litany of curses during the first mile of his return and was down to swearing in Gaelic by the time he reached his yard.<br><br>He stopped in the middle of two dozen foraging chickens that had escaped out the open henhouse door, and looked back at TarStone to see the rising sun peeking over its summit.<br><br>"It looks like scrambled money for breakfast again," Cody said as he stepped out of the henhouse, snapping a wrinkled dollar bill between his hands. "We got any cheese to go with this?" he continued despite Robbie's warning glare. "Ain't nothing like burnt toast and dollar-bill omelets to start the day right."<br><br>Robbie took a threatening step forward.<br><br>The sixteen-year-old juvenile delinquent pocketed the dollar bill, crossed his arms over his chest, and smiled. "Is that egg I see on your face, boss?" he asked.<br><br>Robbie also folded his arms over his chest. "No, you're seeing my decision that you're cooking breakfast."<br><br>Cody's smile disappeared. "I cooked yesterday."<br><br>"You did such a fine job and you can do it again today."<br><br>Muttering what Robbie guessed was a nasty curse, Cody stomped off toward the house. The screen door opened and Gunter stepped onto the porch, moving aside to let Cody go slamming past him.<br><br>Robbie sighed. Gunter wasn't dressed for school, but for work. With his arms still crossed over his chest, Robbie turned to face his next challenge.<br><br>"Harley called. Two of the loggers are sick," Gunter said as he approached. "So I'm going to work today."<br><br>Robbie wasn't surprised that the eighteen-year-old would rather spend a day of hard labor in the woods than go to school. Hell, Gunter would rather muck out stalls than go to school.<br><br>"Harley said two loads of saw logs are leaving today," Gunter continued, stopping in front of Robbie, his nearly black eyes more eager than defensive for a change. "You need me to run the loader."<br><br>"I can run the loader."<br><br>"You have a meeting with Judge Judy this morning."<br><br>Damn. He did. And those saw logs needed to go out today.<br><br>"Her name is Judge Bailey, and she's all that's standing between you and an eight-by-ten cell."<br><br>"I only have metal shop and one regular class today," Gunter continued. "I'll make it up tomorrow."<br><br>Robbie returned Gunter's direct stare and weighed the boy's need for an education against his desire to escape the structure of the classroom.<br><br>Hell, everyone needed a safety valve occasionally, and a long day working in the woods just might serve to remind Gunter that an education would make him an easier living.<br><br>Besides, the kid deserved a reward for going two whole months without starting a fight at school.<br><br>Robbie nodded agreement. "Tell Harley I'll come out to the site after my meeting with Bailey. And Gunter?" he said as the boy turned to leave. "You only have ten weeks left to get your diploma. Anyone can endure anything for ten weeks."<br><br>A faint grin appeared on Gunter's usually stoic face. "I've endured your cooking for a month," he said softly.<br><br>Bolstered by that grin, Robbie smiled. "Gram Katie is bringing over a lasagna for us tonight," he offered in concession. "With salad and homemade rolls."<br><br>Gunter turned fully to face Robbie, his expression serious. "When are you going to look for another housekeeper?"<br><br>Robbie shook his head. "Word's out about you hoodlums. I couldn't offer enough money to bring another woman here."<br><br>"We've learned our lesson," Gunter said. "If it will save us from your cooking and doing our own laundry, we'll treat her like the queen herself."<br><br>"I'll be sure to put that in the ad," Robbie said, turning at the sound of a cane tapping a hurried rhythm on gravel.<br><br>Gunter turned, too. And seeing Father Daar walking down the driveway from the woods, the boy spun on his heel and sprinted for the house.<br><br>It took all of Robbie's willpower not to do the same.<br><br>"I'm wanting a word with you, Robbie," Daar said, using his cane to scatter the chickens. "I need your help on a matter."<br><br>"If this is about your well pump, I've already ordered a new one," Robbie said, hoping to forestall the old priest who lived in a cabin halfway up TarStone Mountain. "It'll be in tomorrow, and the boys and I will install it after school."<br><br>Daar was shaking his head. "I'm not here about the pump." He stepped closer and lowered his voice when Rick came rushing out of the house. "It's a bit more important than that."<br><br>"Peter overstuffed the dryer again and started a fire!" Rick shouted from the porch. "Where's the extinguisher?"<br><br>Robbie bolted for the house, leaving the priest in a flurry of flapping hens. This was all he needed, for his mother's old homestead -- which had survived four generations of Sutters -- to be burned to the ground by a fifteen-year-old delinquent who thought household appliances were really demons trying to suck him into the netherworld.<br><br>This was the second fire Peter had started this month. Three weeks ago, it had been the toaster, along with the curtains, and part of one cupboard that had gone up in flames. They still hadn't gotten the smell out of the house.<br><br>Robbie grabbed the fire extinguisher hanging on a peg not two feet behind Rick, ran into the laundry room, and doused the flames already spreading up the wall.<br><br>Stepping back into the kitchen, wiping powder off his face, Robbie scanned the group of wide-eyed young men staring at him as if he held their fates in his hand. Which he did.<br><br>Four boys, all wards of the state, all in his care for the last eight months. Well, except for Gunter. Gunter had been liberated on his eighteenth birthday six weeks ago, but the boy seemed in no hurry to leave.<br><br>That was fine with Robbie. For as long as it took Gunter to get a toehold on life, he would have a home here.<br><br>Much to Judge Bailey's dismay.<br><br>Bailey did not care to see the other three boys, especially fifteen-year-old Peter, living under the same roof with a known brawler who was nefarious in three county courtrooms and assorted detention centers. Hence today's meeting.<br><br>f0 "You moron!" Rick said, punching Peter in the arm. "Are you <i>trying</i> to get us sent back to foster care?"<br><br>"What in hell is <i>this</i> place?" Peter growled, rubbing his arm and glaring at his older brother.<br><br>"This ain't no foster home," Rick snapped. "And it's a hell of a lot better than the detention center. Dammit, I'm not leaving here because of you," he said, moving to punch him again.<br><br>Robbie caught Rick's fist in his own. "Nobody is going anywhere but to school," he said softly. "If the house burns down, we'll live in the barn. You're all staying here until you decide you'd rather be someplace else."<br><br>"It would be easier if you'd just hire a new housekeeper," Cody said, pulling his burning toast from the shiny new toaster.<br><br>"We'd have a housekeeper if you hadn't run off the last three," Robbie reminded him.<br><br>"None of them had a sense of humor," Cody said with a snort, scraping the black off his toast into the sink.<br><br>"I'll be sure to put that in the ad," Robbie said, setting the empty fire extinguisher by the door to take to town and refill again. He headed into the downstairs bathroom to wash his face and hands. "You boys have to take the school bus today," he said through the open door. "Gunter, take the pickup to work." He stepped back out of the bathroom, wiping his hands on his shirttail because he couldn't find a towel. "And don't go anywhere but to work and back," he warned, giving the youth a level stare. "And don't make me sorry for letting you miss school," he added quietly.<br><br>"How come Gunter isn't going to school?" Peter asked.<br><br>"Because I already learned how to run a dryer and a toaster without starting a fire," Gunter told him.<br><br>"Where? In home ec?"<br><br>It took only a threatening step forward from Robbie to stop Gunter's advance on Peter and a warning growl to get all four boys moving toward the door.<br><br>" 'Morning, Father," Cody said around a mouthful of toast as he stepped aside to let the priest in the house.<br><br>" 'Morning, Father," Gunter mumbled as he squeezed by.<br><br>" 'Morning, Father," both Rick and Peter said as they rushed out to the safety of the yard.<br><br>Daar gave each of them a silent glare as they strode past.<br><br>Robbie couldn't help but smile. For the last eight months, the old priest had used sheer terror to bully the boys into respecting him. Daar had given them a piercing glare upon their arrival, pointed his cherrywood cane at them, explained he was really a wizard, and warned that if they didn't act civil around him, he'd turn them all into dung beetles with his powerful staff.<br><br>They'd nodded respectfully, only to roll their eyes at each other once they turned away, apparently deciding to humor the obviously crazy old man.<br><br>Robbie wondered what their reaction would be if they knew Daar really was a wizard?<br><br>His full name was Pendaï¿½r, and besides turning delinquents into dung beetles, the ancient <i>drï¿½idh</i> was also capable of bringing ten Highland warriors eight hundred years forward through time. Robbie knew this because his father, Michael MacBain, had been born in twelfth-century Scotland. So had Robbie's uncle Greylen MacKeage, along with Morgan, Ian, and Callum MacKeage.<br><br>And since providence had seen fit to gift Robbie with the powers of guardianship over his two clans, the warriors had happily dropped Daar's care onto his capable shoulders about five years ago, after many lectures that Robbie not believe <i>anything</i> the old priest told him. It had been a long five years, with innumerable escapades that could have turned into disasters but for Robbie's vigilance.<br><br>"About my little matter," Daar said, waving a hand through the lingering smoke as he made his way to the kitchen table.<br><br>"I'm afraid it will have to wait," Robbie said, going over to the counter and pouring them both a cup of coffee. "My day just filled up. I now have to buy a clothes dryer on my way to see Judge Bailey."<br><br>Daar snorted and thumped his cane on the floor. "I could take care of that old hag if you'd let me."<br><br>"Martha Bailey is not old and she's not a hag," Robbie told him, setting a cup of coffee in front of him. "She's only doing her job." He took a seat at the table. "And our deal is you don't mess with the magic if you want to stay living on TarStone Mountain."<br><br>Daar harrumphed, took a sip of his coffee, and shuddered in disgust before taking another sip.<br><br>Robbie took a sip of his own coffee, stood up, dumped it down the sink, and went to the fridge to look for some juice.<br><br>"My matter can't wait," Daar said. "The vernal equinox is tomorrow."<br><br>Robbie stilled, the fine hairs on the back of his neck rising in alarm. He slowly straightened from peering into the fridge and looked at the priest. "What's so important about the vernal equinox?"<br><br>"All the planets will be lined up just right."<br><br>"Right for what?"<br><br>"To fix this little problem we have."<br><br>It was the "we" that most alarmed Robbie. Daar's little problems had a way of becoming huge headaches for Robbie, and when "we" was attached, it usually meant a full-blown migraine.<br><br>Robbie closed the fridge door, set his fists on his hips, and glared at the priest. "And what exactly is <i>our</i> problem?"<br><br>Daar turned away to face the table and spoke to his coffee cup. "Your papa and the others are going back to their old time come June," he whispered.<br><br>Robbie could only stare at Daar's back.<br><br>"I have only three months to extend the spell that brought them here," the <i>drï¿½idh</i> continued to his coffee. He finally turned to look at Robbie. "They will have been here thirty-five years on this summer's solstice, and that's when the spell runs out."<br><br>It wasn't a headache Robbie felt but a painful pounding in his chest that made it difficult to breathe. He was going to lose his father in three months?

As her husband scrambles to figure out what happened to her, Elyria hurtles into the unknown, testing fate by hitchhiking, tacitly being swept into the lives of strangers, and sleeping in fields, forests, and public parks.<br> Her risky and often surreal encounters with the people and wildlife of New Zealand propel Elyria deeper into her deteriorating mind. Haunted by her sister's death and consumed by an inner violence, her growing rage remains so expertly concealed that those who meet her sense nothing unwell. This discord between her inner and outer reality leads her to another obsession: If her truest self is invisible and unknowable to others, is she even alive?<br> The risks Elyria takes on her journey are paralleled by the risks Catherine Lacey takes on the page. In urgent, spiraling prose she whittles away at the rage within Elyria and exposes the very real, very knowable anxiety of the human condition. And yet somehow Lacey manages to poke fun at her unrelenting self-consciousness, her high-stakes search for the dark heart of the self. In the spirit of Haruki Murakami and Amelia Gray, <i>Nobody Is Ever Missing</i> is full of mordant humor and uncanny insights, as Elyria waffles between obsession and numbness in the face of love, loss, danger, and self-knowledge.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Lacey</b> was named a <i>Granta</i> <i>New Voice</i> of 2014 and a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellow for fiction writing in 2012.

She was born in Mississippi.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There might be people in this world who can read minds against their will and if that kind of person exists I am pretty sure my husband is one of them. I think this because of what happened the week I knew I&#x2019;d be leaving soon, but he didn&#x2019;t know; I knew I needed to tell him this but I couldn&#x2019;t imagine any possible way to get my mouth to make those words, and since my husband can unintentionally read minds, he drank a good deal more than usual that week, jars of gin mostly, but tall beers from the deli, too. He&#x2019;d walk in sipping a can hidden in a paper bag, smile like it was a joke.</p> <p>I would laugh.</p> <p>He would laugh.</p> <p>Inside our laughing we weren&#x2019;t really laughing.</p> <p>The morning I left he got out of bed, got dressed, and left the room. I stayed cold awake under shut lids until I heard our front door close. I left the apartment at noon wearing my backpack and I felt so sick and absurd that I walked into a bar instead of the subway. I ordered a double bourbon even though I don&#x2019;t usually drink like that and the bartender asked me where I was from and I said Germany for no good reason, or maybe just so he wouldn&#x2019;t try to talk to me, or maybe because I needed to live in some other story for a half hour: I was a lone German woman, here to see the Statue of Liberty and the Square of Time and the Park of Central (not a woman taking a one-way flight to a country where she only knew one person, who had only once extended an offer of his guest room, which, when she thought of it again, seemed to be the kind of invitation a person extends when they know it won&#x2019;t be taken but it was too late now because I was taking it and oh well oh well oh well).</p> <p>A man took the stool beside me despite a long row of empties, ordered a cranberry and nothing.</p> <p><i>What&#x2019;s your trouble?</i> he asked me. <i>Tell me your trouble, baby</i>.</p> <p>I looked back at him like I didn&#x2019;t have any trouble to tell because that&#x2019;s my trouble, I thought, not knowing how to tell it, and this is why my favorite thing about airport security is how you can cry the whole way through and they&#x2019;ll only try to figure out whether you&#x2019;ll blow up. They&#x2019;ll still search you if they want to search you. They&#x2019;ll still try to detect metal on you. They&#x2019;ll still yell about laptops and liquids and gels and shoes, and no one will ask what&#x2019;s wrong because everything is already wrong, and they won&#x2019;t look twice at you because they&#x2019;re only paid to look once. And for this, sometimes, some people are thankful.</p> <p>2</p> <p>They looked and made quick calculations: a 7 percent chance of con artistry, 4 percent chance of prostitution, 50 percent chance of mental instability, 20 percent chance of obnoxiousness, a 4 percent chance of violent behavior. I was probably none of these things, at least not at first, but to all the passing drivers and everyone else in this country I could be anything, so they just slowed, had a look, made a guess, kept driving.</p> <p>Women&#x2014;they&#x2019;d squint quick, make a worried face, continue on. Men (I later learned) stared from the farthest distance&#x2014;their eyes trained to stay on me in case I was something they needed to shoot or capture&#x2014;but they hardly ever stopped. Up close, I was not so promising: just a woman wearing a backpack, a cardigan, green sneakers. And young-seeming, of course, because you must seem young to get away with this kind of vulnerability, standing on a road&#x2019;s shoulder, showing the pale underside of your arm. You must seem both totally harmless and able, if necessary, to push a knife through any tender gut.</p> <p>But I didn&#x2019;t know any of this at first&#x2014;I just stood and waited, not knowing that wearing sunglasses would always leave me stranded, not knowing that wearing my hair down meant something I did not mean, not knowing that my posture had to be so carefully calibrated, that I should always stand like a dancer ready to leap.</p> <p>All I knew was what I&#x2019;d read on that map at the airport: south until I hit Wellington, across on the ferry, then Picton, Nelson, Takaka, and Golden Bay, Werner&#x2019;s farm, the address scrawled on that bit of paper that had started all this.</p> <p>When the plane landed that morning, I hadn&#x2019;t slept for thirty-seven hours or so. After they&#x2019;d dimmed the lights I&#x2019;d kept my eyes wide, my brain cruising into an endless horizon. I didn&#x2019;t read anything or watch anything on the screen inches from my face. I listened to sleeping bodies breathe; I tried to pick words out of feathery voices, rows away. The flight attendants swayed down the aisles and winked and pursed their lips and handed me very certain amounts of food substance: bread roll smooth as a lightbulb; tongue-sized piece of chicken; thirty-two peanuts in a metallic pocket. I bit into a flap of cheese, not noticing the plastic, then gave up on food.</p> <p>Outside baggage claim I watched a man smoking a cigarette and kicking something along the curb, sunlight splintering around him like a painting of a saint. This was all it was, this country I&#x2019;d catapulted into.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p><i>Oh, how could I not stop for you?</i> that first driver asked. <i>How could I not?</i></p> <p><i>I don&#x2019;t know</i>, I said. <i>How could you?</i></p> <p>The woman laughed but I was not in a place to see humor. I suppose it had been funny, but when I stared back at her with nothing on my face she stopped laughing. A long, curved nose gave her the regal but unflattering look of a falcon or toucan. She spoke to me like I was a child, which was fine because I wanted to be one. Lately, I couldn&#x2019;t remember those years, as if childhood was a movie I&#x2019;d only seen the previews to.</p> <p><i>You&#x2019;re a brave lass, aren&#x2019;t you? Don&#x2019;t see many like you out on the road.</i></p> <p>There&#x2019;s a certain kind of woman who will notice someone&#x2019;s terror and call it bravery.</p> <p><i>I thought lots of people hitchhiked here.</i></p> <p><i>Oh, not too many</i>, she said. <i>Not anymore. Everywhere is dangerous these days. Would you have a pear? Help yourself to a Nashi. I have loads of &#x2019;em, a special at the grocery.</i></p> <p>She told me about her eleven-year-old son, an accident she&#x2019;d made in her twenties, and I ate a pear with the juice going everywhere, but she was only going to Papakura, so she let me out by a petrol station not far down the highway.</p> <p><i>Don&#x2019;t you let any blokes pick you up, you hear? If one stops, you just let him keep going. We&#x2019;re always keeping an eye out, other women, you know. Another will stop for you soon enough.</i></p> <p>I said I would, but I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t take her advice, because I can never manage to reject anyone&#x2019;s offer of anything; this was one of the only things about myself of which I was certain.</p> <p>For a while there were no cars to show my thumb to, but I kept standing there, not even having an appropriate curiosity about this new country (a boring little mountain, a plain blue lake, a gas station, the same as ours only slightly not). The skin on my lips was drying and I thought about how all the cells on every body are on their way to a total lack of moisture and everyone alive has that thought all the time but almost no one says it and no one says it because they don&#x2019;t really <i>think</i> that thought, they just have it, like they have toes, like most people have toes; and the knowledge that we&#x2019;re all drying up is what presses the gas pedal in all the cars people drive away from where they are, which reminded me that I wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere, and I noticed that many cars had passed but none had stopped or even slowed, and I began to wonder about what would happen if no one took me, if the first woman had been a fluke and hitchhiking had been left in the seventies with other now-dangerous things&#x2014;lead paint, certain plastics, free love&#x2014;and I was going to be stuck here forever, watching no cars drive by, thinking about my cells all helpless to their drying.</p> <p>I decided to try to look happy because I thought someone might be more inclined to pick up someone who was happy.</p> <p><i>I am happy</i>, I told myself, <i>I am a happy person.</i></p> <p>I opened my eyes more than was necessary and hoped this would convey my happiness to the cars, but they kept passing.</p> <p>One honked, as if to say, <i>No</i>.</p> <p>My arm stayed out for a long time and my elbow ached at the spot where they&#x2019;d always taken the blood, and I became so accustomed to the passing cars that I forgot that the point of all this was for me to get into a car and go somewhere, but nothing was following anything else&#x2014;one car would pass, then another, but all the cars came and went alone. And I was here. And nothing had followed me&#x2014;I was a human non sequitur&#x2014;senseless and misplaced, a bad joke, a joke with no place to land. The sky was a good sky color and the air was healthy feeling, and maybe this was the kind of day that reminded all those drivers that days are a finite resource and it&#x2019;s best to protect the ones you have. This kind of day doesn&#x2019;t want you to dare it, doesn&#x2019;t want you to flip a coin, doesn&#x2019;t want you to pick up a stranger off the side of the road.</p> <p>But eventually that first woman was proven right&#x2014;it was the women who stopped, who insisted they <i>never</i> picked up hitchhikers, only women with thumbs out, damsels in transportation distress&#x2014;which was what the second woman said, and I thought, Sure, fine, whatever&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t going to mince words with anyone. There was no reason for that. She was on her way home from a hospital where she was a nurse, so I asked her what I had been thinking about ever since that last day at the lab:</p> <p><i>What do they do with the blood? After they&#x2019;re done with it, I mean.</i></p> <p><i>What blood?</i> she asked.</p> <p><i>When they test it. After they test it for disease or hormone levels or whatever. All those tubes of it&#x2014;what happens?</i></p> <p><i>Well, they dispose of it. It is hazardous waste.</i></p> <p><i>But where does it go?</i></p> <p><i>Into a secure place. First a tube, then a hazardous-waste container, then the containers are taken away by a company. They put it somewhere safe and secure and no one ever touches it ever again.</i></p> <p>And that put an end to our talking. We didn&#x2019;t say another thing until she let me out where she had to let me out.</p> <p><i>Good luck</i>, she said, <i>take care. And stay away from those blokes.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Catherine Lacey</p></p><h2>The Best Polish Restaurant in Buffalo</h2><p>A masterful blend of historical and modern fiction by a best-selling, award-winning author, THE BEST POLISH RESTAURANT IN BUFFALO chronicles a century of life in America for one humble Polish farm girl and three generations of her descendants in Buffalo, New York.</p><p>William Kowalski is the author of the international best-sellers EDDIE&#39;S BASTARD and SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF HERE, and a dozen other books.

Find out why tourists are flocking to a hellish little town in a post-nuclear Kansas. Meet a warlock who practices on Park Avenue and whose potions comply with the Pure Food and Drug Act. Make a deal with the Devil&#x2014;but not without calling your agent. Dazzling, effervescent, sexy, and sardonic, Virtual Unrealities is a historic collection from one of science fiction's true pathbreakers. <br><br>"Alfred Bester was one of the handful of writers who invented modern science fiction. "<br>&#x2014;Harry Harrison</p><p>Alfred Bester (1913-1987) was the author of two of science fiction's seminal works, <i>The Demolished Man</i> and <i>The Stars My Destination</i>. He also wrote some fast-moving, sizzling short stories that were very highly regarded; many of them are included in the 17 stories showcased in <i>Virtual Realities</i>; two were never before published. Highlights include "Disappearing Act," in which shell-shocked soldiers vanish from their hospital ward; "Hobson's Choice," in which a statistician uncovers a disturbing population trend in post-nuclear Kansas; "Time Is the Traitor," wherein powerful business people manipulate their most valuable consultant; and "The Devil Without Glasses," a conspiracy tale with an <i>X-Files</i> feel. The science fiction and literary classic "Fondly Fahrenheit" stars wealthy Vandaleur and his mad android who has an unfortunate habit of turning murderous when the temperature gets too hot... All reet! <p> Bester's use of the word <i>girl</i> and the occasional female as manipulating schemer are not in line with current sensibilities and may give readers pause, especially those accustomed to feminist improvements in modern SF. Nevertheless, these stories are a frenetic and delightful confection of SF from the mid-20th century. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p><b>Alfred Bester</b>&nbsp;was a beloved sci-fi author, writer, magazine editor, and scripter for newspaper strips and comic books. <i>The Demolished Man</i>, his best remembered title, won the inaugural Hugo Award in 1953. He is also the author of <i>Psychoshop, Tender Loving Rage,&nbsp;The Deceivers, </i>and many more pieces of long and short fiction. Bester is considered to be one of the most influential sci-fi writers of the 20th Century.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Roger Zelazny</b>&nbsp;burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for Lord of Light, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular Amber series,&nbsp;<i>Nine Princes in Amber</i>. In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career.

But this year it&#x2019;s in for a jolt when Monica Whitman moves into town. She&#x2019;s a dynamo who wants to make friends fast in her new home, and she throws herself into community activities. Meg Corey, now Chapin after her marriage to Seth Chapin, is intrigued by the new arrival, who has already sold the town board on a new, fun way to bring in visitors during the off-season: WinterFare, which will feature local foods (such as Meg&#x2019;s apples) and crafts, as well as entertainment.&nbsp;<br><br>Tragically, Monica falls ill and dies after the event in what looks like a case of food poisoning. When all the food served at WinterFare has been tested, including Meg&#x2019;s apples, it becomes clear that there&#x2019;s a more sinister explanation to the older woman&#x2019;s sudden demise.&nbsp;<br><br>Meg&#x2019;s investigation uncovers a bushel of potential suspects, one of whom is rotten to the core.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>INCLUDES DELICIOUS RECIPES</b></p><p><b>Sheila Connolly</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling, Anthony and Agatha award-nominated author of the Orchard Mysteries, the Museum Mysteries, and the County Cork Mysteries. She has taught art history, structured and marketed municipal bonds for major cities, worked as a staff member on two statewide political campaigns, and served as a fundraiser for several nonprofit organizations. She also managed her own consulting company, providing genealogical research services. In addition to genealogy, Sheila loves restoring old houses, visiting cemeteries, and traveling. Now a full-time writer, she thinks writing mysteries is a lot more fun than any of her previous occupations.&nbsp;She is married and has one daughter and three cats.1<br><br> "Did we celebrate Christmas this year?" Meg Corey Chapin asked her still-newish husband, Seth.<br><br> He turned from the stove in the kitchen, holding up a coffeepot. "More?"<br><br> "Please!" Meg told him.<br><br> Seth refilled her cup, topped off his, and sat down across from her at the kitchen table. His dog, Max, a solidly built Golden Retriever, laid a head on his foot and resumed his nap. "Christmas . . . yes, I believe we did. I seem to remember there was a tree, and boxes with paper and ribbons on them, and family members kept popping in. Why are you asking now?"<br><br> "Because it all seems like a blur. After the honeymoon, which wasn't exactly normal or typical&#x2014;not that I'm complaining, and it wasn't our fault that we got stuck solving a murder&#x2014;we came back and Bree told us she was taking another job and leaving in two weeks, and somehow I haven't gotten things together since. Thank goodness there's nothing that absolutely needs to be done right now in the orchard."<br><br> "It's too bad Bree had to leave," Seth agreed.<br><br> Bree had been Meg's orchard manager since she'd first arrived in Granford to find she owned an apple orchard and might actually need to make an income from it. When they'd first met, Bree had recently graduated from UMass in nearby Amherst, but she was young, untested, female, and born to Jamaican parents, any of which could have been an impediment to finding a job in agriculture. But she'd come highly recommended by a respected professor at UMass, Christopher Ramsdell, born in Australia, and Meg knew she needed someone to manage the orchard, since she was clueless about it, so she'd agreed to hire Bree. Christopher had been using the orchard as a sort of living demonstration for his students, so he knew it well. Meg had hoped that he had transferred most of that information to Bree, and it turned out that he had.<br><br> Meg couldn't afford to pay Bree much. She had thrown in free housing to sweeten the deal, so since her arrival Bree had been living in the Colonial house Meg had acquired along with the orchard. She'd proved to be a good roommate: she had kept to herself, done her share of the cooking and cleaning, and been invaluable to Meg in getting to know her orchard and learning what trees she had and how to harvest, store, and sell the apples. Bree's Achilles' heel was keeping financial records for the orchard, although she was good at tracking what had been done with which trees and what needed to be done from year to year. But Meg could more than compensate on the financial side since most of her professional experience had come from years of working in a Boston bank. They'd made a good team, even after Seth had started spending more and more time at the house, until they had finally married in December, almost two years after Meg had moved to Granford.<br><br> And then Bree had left for an internship in Australia, with Meg's blessing. She wanted Bree to succeed and be happy, but it had left her high and dry. Even after two years, there was still a lot she didn't know about growing apples.<br><br> "Tell me about it," Meg told Seth. "But Christopher said he had a good candidate to replace her."<br><br> "You think she'll come back here?"<br><br> "I really don't know. Selfishly I'd like that, but I want her to do well, so I can't exactly stand in her way. We'll have to see how the new person works out."<br><br> "You have anything major on your calendar?" Seth asked.<br><br> "Not until we need to prune, and that's not urgent&#x2014;yet. You?"<br><br> "A few small clean-up projects, and I suppose I should start drumming up some new business for when the weather warms up."<br><br> "You like the old-house projects better?" Meg asked. Seth had been a plumber, running what had been his father's small company, when they'd first met, but his heart lay in house renovation and restoration, mainly for the older buildings in the area, and there were plenty of those.<br><br> "Better than what?" he replied. "There aren't a lot of major projects coming down the pike. Well, the town is still wrestling with what to do with the old library, now that the new one is open, but if they can't decide what that building should be, they can't exactly advertise for architects, much less contractors. And there might be a conflict of interest, since I'm a town selectman. You and I both know I'd give them a fair estimate, but we don't want anybody to challenge the process. I'm okay with that."<br><br> "And that's the only major project? That suits your particular skills, that is?"<br><br> "For now. Most people wait until winter's over to see what work their homes need, so I'm not worried. Besides, you can support me, right?"<br><br> "In your dreams! But we'll always have apples to eat. I can plant a garden, and maybe you can trap a muskrat or two in the swamp."<br><br> "There aren't a lot of muskrats in Massachusetts, and I think you need a permit to trap them. You want to make a fur coat? I'm not about to shoot anything. How do you feel about eating frogs?"<br><br> "I've tried them once, I think. Kinda like chicken? But not a lot of meat on them." Meg took another sip of her coffee. "So, the bottom line is, there's nothing either one of us has to do today?"<br><br> "Looks like it. You have any ideas?"<br><br> "I am at a total loss. I don't know what to do with spare time anymore. And I refuse to look at spreadsheets, though I know taxes are looming. Even if I was a financial professional."<br><br> "We should discuss our shared finances at some point, you know," Seth said.<br><br> "My head knows it, but right now I don't wanna. Very adult of me, isn't it?"<br><br> "We could schedule a time. You know, we've got two unrelated businesses to consider, both of which are sole proprietorships, and the details are complicated."<br><br> "Seth, my love, you are depressing me. You think I don't know that? Let me ask you this: do we have money in the bank right now, after all the wedding and honeymoon hoo-hah?"<br><br> "So that was hoo-hah? Live and learn. Yes, we have some money, and we can cover our bills. But we may never be able to retire."<br><br> "That is the farthest thing from my mind at the moment."<br><br> Their banter was interrupted by an insistent banging on the front door. "What time is it?" Meg asked. "That much noise this early is seldom good news. And nobody who knows us uses that door."<br><br> "So you want me to go, right?" Seth said, smiling.<br><br> "If you will, please, sir. I've got your back."<br><br> Seth stood up and headed through the dining room and the living room to the front door. Meg didn't move. Please, let it not be a crisis. They'd had more than their share in recent months. She heard the creak of the door opening, and the rumble of male voices. All right, their unexpected caller was male. Salesman? State trooper? Religious fanatic? She couldn't begin to guess. Luckily Seth returned quickly, followed by a twentysomething guy wearing well-worn clothes and a heavy, shapeless coat. He was shorter than Seth&#x2014;maybe about her height? He could use a haircut, but at least he didn't have one of the scruffy beards that seemed to be popular among his age group.<br><br> "Meg, this is Larry Bennett. He says Christopher sent him."<br><br> "Hey, hi," the guy said. "Sorry&#x2014;Christopher said he'd meet me here so we could do the introduction thing. He told me you needed an orchard manager?"<br><br> "Ah. Yes, we do," Meg said. "Please, sit down. You want some coffee?"<br><br> Larry sat. "Yeah, sure. Please," he added as an afterthought.<br><br> "Seth, can you do the honors with the coffee?" Meg asked. "I'm Meg Corey, uh, Chapin. Sorry, Seth, but I'm still getting used to it."<br><br> "No problem&#x2014;I think my ego will survive." He set a mug of coffee in front of Larry and took a seat next to Meg.<br><br> "We just got married last month," Meg explained, feeling foolish. "I don't know how much Christopher has told you, but I'll give you the short version while we wait. I kind of inherited this place about two years ago, and when I decided to stay I realized I'd have to make a living from the orchard, if possible. But I had no experience, so Christopher suggested I hire Bree&#x2014;Briona Stewart&#x2014;who was one of his students. Did he explain all this?"<br><br> "Not a lot. So she's been working here for two years? Why's she leaving?"<br><br> "She was offered an internship in Australia, which would be a big plus on her rï¿½sumï¿½, and I told her she should take it. She left right after New Year's."<br><br> "So you need someone to manage the whole thing? What've you got?"<br><br> "'Bout fifteen acres of mature trees, and we put in another three acres of new trees last year, mostly heirlooms."<br><br> "What do you do for storage?"<br><br> "Seth built some refrigerated storage units in the barn when we started, but mostly I sell direct to local markets."<br><br> "So no big contracts?"<br><br> "No, and I'm not looking for any right now," Meg said, reflecting that this Larry person wasn't exactly making nice with his new employer, although he was asking the right questions. A little rough around the social edges?<br><br> Larry turned to Seth. "You&#x2014;Seth, is it?&#x2014;you work in the orchard, too?"<br><br> "No, I'm a renovator, but I know plumbing. Separate operation, but I use the building next to the barn as my office space."<br><br> "Other employees?" Larry turned back to Meg, dismissing Seth abruptly.<br><br> "Bree set up a team of pickers for me who come in for the harvest."<br><br> "No automation?"<br><br> "Not for the picking. No, we pick by hand, and move the apples around with our tractor. When there's a drought, which we have had recently, there's a well that supplies the orchard, but we need to install a new pumping system."<br><br> "Expensive," Larry said.<br><br> "Yes, it will be." Meg decided it was time to take charge. After all, she was supposed to be interviewing him, not the other way around. "What's your background?"<br><br> "I've got a degree in plant sciences from Cornell. You know about their apple programs, right?"<br><br> "I've heard of them, but I haven't visited. It's on my wish list. When did you graduate?"<br><br> "A couple of years ago."<br><br> "And what have you been doing since?"<br><br> "I've taken a bunch of graduate-level agricultural courses at UMass&#x2014;that's how I met Christopher. There was some grant funding for apple research projects, so I was working on those. I haven't made up my mind if I want to go for a grad degree, but I need a job."<br><br> "Have you worked in an orchard before?"<br><br> "My folks had one, but they're gone now, and so's the orchard."<br><br> "Why do you want this job? We're pretty small, and there's not a lot of room to grow. What can you learn here?"<br><br> "Look, I need a paycheck, all right? I know apples, and there are some good ideas I picked up, that I'd like to try out."<br><br> "Assuming I'm willing. You'd be working for me, and I need to be part of making any decisions."<br><br> Larry looked like he was swallowing a comment, but in the end he said, "Yeah, I get that. But I can bring new ideas to you, right?"<br><br> "Of course. I don't pretend to know everything, but I wanted to be clear from the start. I'm willing to listen to you."<br><br> Meg sat back and contemplated this Larry person. He was kind of abrasive. Defensive? Or just obnoxious? And young. Still, if he'd been raised with an orchard, he must have more experience than Bree had when she took on the job. And if Christopher vouched for him, he must have something going for him. Where the heck was Christopher, anyway? A knock at the back door answered that question. Meg got up to let Christopher in.<br><br> "So sorry I'm late, Meg, my dear. Seth. Ah, I see my young protï¿½gï¿½e has arrived. How've you been getting on, Larry?"<br><br> Larry shrugged. "Okay, I guess."<br><br> "Coffee, Christopher?" Seth asked.<br><br> "Oh, no, no, thank you. I've had my fill for this morning."<br><br> "Have you heard from Bree, Christopher?" Meg asked.<br><br> "My contact in Australia informs me that she arrived safely and is quick to learn. I don't expect to hear much more from her. And you?"<br><br> "No, but I assume she's busy." Not that Bree owed her any personal contact. They'd moved past an employer-employee relationship, but stopped somewhere short of friends.<br><br> "Has Larry seen your property yet?" Christopher changed the subject adroitly.<br><br> "Just from the road," Larry said. "We were talking about the job."<br><br> "Well, then, I suggest we take a look at the orchard and the relevant facilities," Christopher said, rubbing his hands together.<br><br> "I'll leave you to it," Seth said. "I've got some other chores to do."<br><br> "Seth, can you feed the goats, please?" Meg asked.<br><br> "Sure, no problem. And I'll give Max some exercise, too."<br><br> Meg stood up. "Well, then, let's take the tour." They gathered up their coats, and Meg led the way out the back door, followed by Christopher and Larry.<br><br> 2<br><br> "Ask any questions you want, Larry," Meg said. They stood huddled together in the driveway, shivering in the January wind. Meg pointed. "That's Seth's office space, at the end of the driveway. The barn is obviously the barn. That's where the storage for the apples is."<br><br> "Can we take a look at that?" Larry asked.<br><br> "Sure." Meg led them to the front of the barn and hauled open one of the big double doors. Inside, she pointed to the apple storage units aligned along one wall. "That's what we've got, the ones Seth built."<br><br> "How full are they now?" Larry asked.<br><br> "About twenty-five percent, I think. The ones that ripened late or hold well."<br><br> "Where were the apples kept before you built these?"<br><br> "You'd do better to ask Christopher. I've got a pretty short history here."<br><br> Christopher spoke up. "We had no holding facilities here then. The university managed this as an experimental orchard, and while some of the apples were sold commercially, that was not a priority. Some went to the university kitchens, others to local shelters."<br><br> "So you were more interested in managing the trees than in optimizing the crop?" Larry asked.<br><br> "Yes. That's how I chose to define my mandate," Christopher said. "The sale and marketing aspects were handled by others. In your opinion, young Mr. Bennett, would this division of labor have had an impact on the crop?"<br><br> "Maybe. If you'd been interested in producing more apples, or modifying size or resistance, you might have made different choices."</p><h2>Book of My Nights: Poems (American Poets Continuum, 68)</h2><p><p><i>Book of My Nights</i> is the first poetry collection in ten years by one of the world's most acclaimed young poets.

Breaking the Alabaster Jar is an invaluable companion to Li-Young Lee's previous award-winning poetry collections.<br><br>Li-Young Lee currently lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife Donna and their two children.<br>assionate and profound, Lee's long-awaited third collection charts the mid-life ontological crisis of a speaker who "can't tell what my father said about the sea... from the sea itself," and finds himself unmoored without that strong male voice. Lee's father was a personal physician to Mao Zedong, who took the family to Jakarta (where Lee was born) in the '50s. As Indonesia began persecuting Chinese citizens and his father was imprisoned, Lee's family left the country, spent five years moving from place to place in Asia, and arrived in the U.S. in 1964. (These events are described in The Winged Seed, Lee's American Book Award-winning memoir of 1995.) Lee has ever been concerned with questions of origins, but in the 11 years since the publication of his last collection, memories of childhood answers furnished by father, mother and siblings now fail to assuage the poet's 3 a.m. doubts. Yet he does not trust himself to formulate answers on his own in these 35 nocturnes, and the father seems to be missing or dead. The poet's tightly wrought, extraordinarily careful and finally heart-wrenching responses finally boil down to one ultimate cry: "Where is his father? Who is his mother?" The complex permutations of these fundamental inquiries and their unsatisfactory answers construct a space in which knowledge and redemption, if never quite attained, always seem possible. Lee is never faced with sheer emptiness; his "silence thunders," a vocal presence to which Lee's speaker responds, "declaring a new circumference/ even the stars enlarge by crowding down to hear." (Sept. 15) Forecast: A favorite on course syllabi, Lee should sell strongly and steadily with this long-awaited new collection. The Winged Seed, first published by S&amp;S, is available in paperback from Ruminator Books, the Minnesota house (and review) formerly called Hungry Mind.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The South Africa Reader: History, Culture, Politics (The World Readers)</h2><p><i>The South Africa Reader</i> is an extraordinarily rich guide to the history, culture, and politics of South Africa.

He acted in his final motion picture just weeks before he died at age ninety-three. He was an iconic presence in movies, the poster boy for American youth in the idyllic small-town 1930s. Yet, by World War II, Mickey Rooney had become frozen in time. A perpetual teenager in an aging body, he was an anachronism by the time he hit his forties.

He lived a long and often messy life, going up and down the ladder of success as if it were a department store elevator. He did everything there was to do in show business: vaudeville, radio, nightclubs, theater, television, and of course movies, where he ranked at the top of the box office in 1939, 1940, and 1941. He could perform both comedy and drama equally well, and he did impressions of everyone from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Carmen Miranda. He sang, he danced. He played the piano, the drums, and the banjo, and he composed music. He also wrote books, taught acting, spearheaded various business ventures, and served his country during World War II, earning the Bronze Star for performing in combat zones.<br> <br>When he died at age ninety-three in April of 2014, Rooney had been working in some form of entertainment for nine decades. Along the way, he won an Emmy, two Golden Globes, and racked up countless nominations for others, including two Oscar bids for Best Actor and two more for Best Supporting Actor. He had also been awarded two honorary Oscars, the first in 1939, for &#x201c;bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth,&#x201d; and another in 1983, &#x201c;for his 60 years of versatility in a variety of memorable performances.&#x201d; The latter award seemed at the time to close the book on Rooney, acknowledging the man who had been performing for more than sixty years. Yet Rooney carried on for another three decades. He died with his boots on, leaving behind small roles in two unreleased movies: Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (2015).<br> <br>Rooney&#x2019;s success is a unique American tale. He wasn&#x2019;t necessarily the type for box office stardom. Standing only a little more than five feet, two inches tall, with a boyish face, a shock of untamable hair, and a sort of &#x201c;gosh, darn&#x201d; demeanor, he might have been limited to a brief career or no career at all, but his prodigious talent transcended his limitations. He proved to be a performance Everyman who could play a wide variety of roles: a maniacal Puck in A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream (1935); a heartbreaking Western Union messenger who delivers the World War II telegrams that announce the deaths of young soldiers in The Human Comedy (1943); the roustabout jockey who helps an adolescent Elizabeth Taylor ride to victory in National Velvet (1944); the down-on-his luck drummer in the underrated The Strip (1951); a doomed GI in The Bold and the Brave (1956); the psychopathic killer in Baby Face Nelson (1957), which won him the French Cï¿½sar Award; a sympathetic boxing trainer in Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962); the elderly and sensitive horseman of Black Stallion (1979); and the mentally handicapped man in the TV movie Bill (1981). Even the horror of his now-politically incorrect Mr. Yonioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s (1961) is somehow fascinating. Yet even without any of these standout roles, Mickey Rooney would be an important part of film history.<br> <br>If he had made only musicals with Judy Garland or just his sixteen-movie series as Andy Hardy, he&#x2019;d still be famous. Rooney and Garland were young and hopeful together, and the wow factor of the energetic talent they unleash in such movies as Babes in Arms (1939) and Girl Crazy (1943), among others, is unparalleled. Rooney said, &#x201c;Judy and I were so close we could&#x2019;ve come from the same womb,&#x201d; and this instinctive sympathy, rhythmic harmony, and mutual survival skills infuse all the numbers they perform. They sing it sweet and they sing it hot, but they are always amazing. And as to his embodiment of Andy Hardy, Rooney is immortal.<br> <br>Despite the fact that he was chasing girls, gambling, drinking, and carousing off-screen while he made films, on-screen Rooney perfectly captures the spirit of an American teenager of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Andy Hardy is often called a fantasy figure, the imaginary kid MGM envisioned to goose up its box office receipts. The character is far more honest and believable than that, or else the low-budget series built around him would never have lasted. There may be hokeyness in the Hardy family stories, but there&#x2019;s also something audiences recognized as true, and that truth was in Mickey Rooney&#x2019;s performance.<br> <br>With so many well-remembered film roles across so many decades, it makes one wonder why Mickey Rooney wasn&#x2019;t more respected in his elder years. For Rooney, there was no Kennedy Center Honors award, no American Film Institute Life Achievement Award, and certainly no luxurious retirement to a villa in Switzerland. (He left only eighteen thousand dollars in his estate.) The older Rooney was always just a little bit over the top, lacking what Hollywood thought was class. He went bankrupt, became addicted to sleeping pills, and ran up gambling debts. He incited lawsuits, quarreled with his family, and often gave crazy interviews that went way beyond what could be labeled as merely eccentric. Most spectacularly of all, he married a legendary (and tacky) eight times. (&#x201c;Always get married in the morning,&#x201d; he was quoted as saying. &#x201c;That way if it doesn&#x2019;t work out, you haven&#x2019;t wasted the whole day.&#x201d;) These very public peccadillos no doubt kept him off the A-list of Hollywood legends&#x2014;except, of course, where it counted: in the history books and in the hearts and memories of his fans.<br> <br>A book that tells Mickey Rooney&#x2019;s full story and puts his life and work in proper perspective has been long overdue, and Bill Birnes and Rick Lertzman have done the job. They don&#x2019;t ignore the embarrassing parts of Rooney or his tragedies and failures, but they emphasize the Mickey Rooney that counts: the one who was first, last, and always a performer who never let his audience down. Birnes and Lertzman understand Rooney, presenting him as a colorful American guy who had it all, lost it all, and regained it all, but no matter what, never gave up. It&#x2019;s the story of a true professional, and a great read by anyone&#x2019;s standards.<br> <br>Jeanine Basinger is the Corwin-Fuller Professor of Film Studies, Wesleyan University, and trustee emerita at the American Film Institute.</p><h2>Beading Artistry for Quilts: Basic Stitches &amp; Embellishments Add Texture &amp; Drama</h2><p>Use beads and simple stitches to create magnificent texture, dimension, and lifelike details on any quilt.

Milne grew up in a school - his parents ran Henley House in Kilburn, for young boys - but never intended to be a children&#39;s writer. Pooh he saw as a pleasant sideline to his main career as a playwright and regular scribe for the satirical literary magazine, Punch. Writing was very much the dominant feature of A.A. (Alan Alexander)&#39;s life. He joined the staff of Punch in 1906, and became Assistant Editor. In the course of two decades he fought in the First World War, wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920 (although he described the baby as being more his wife&#39;s work than his own!). Observations of little Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). After that, in spite of enthusiastic demand, Milne declined to write any more children&#39;s stories as he felt that, with his son growing up, they would now only be copies based on a memory. In one way, Christopher Robin turned out to be more famous than his father, though he became uncomfortable with his fame as he got older, preferring to avoid the literary limelight and run a bookshop in Dartmouth. Nevertheless, he published three volumes of his reminiscences before his death in 1996.</p><h2>Tristan and Iseult: An Inspired Retelling of the Legendary Love Story (Sunburst Book)</h2><p><p>Tristan defeats Ireland's greatest warrior and gains the friendship of his uncle, the King of Cornwall, who entrusts him with a very special mission: to sail the seas in search of a queen.</p></p><p><p><b>Rosemary Sutcliff</b> (1920-1992) wrote dozens of books for young readers, including her award-winning Roman Britain trilogy, <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i>, <i>The Silver Branch</i>, and <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>, which won the Carnegie Medal. <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> is now a major motion picture, The Eagle, directed by Kevin MacDonald and starring Channing Tatum.

Clarke may be the greatest science fiction writer in the world; certainly, he's the best-known, not least because he wrote the novel and coauthored the screenplay of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. He's also the only SF writer to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize or to be knighted by Her Majesty Elizabeth II. This god of SF has twice collaborated with one of the best SF writers to emerge in the 1990s, Stephen Baxter, winner of the British SF Award, the Locus Award, and the Philip K. Dick Award. Their first collaboration is the novel <i>The Light of Other Days</i>. Their second is the novel <i>Time's Eye: Book One of a Time Odyssey</i>.<p> As the subtitle indicates, <i>Time's Eye</i> is the first book of a series intended to do for time what <i>2001</i> did for space. Does <i>Time's Eye</i> succeed in this goal? No. In <i>2001</i>, humanity discovers a mysterious monolith on the moon, triggering a signal that astronauts pursue to one of the moons of Jupiter. In <i>Time's Eye</i>, mysterious satellites appear all around the Earth and scramble time, bringing together an ape-woman; twenty- first-century soldiers and astronauts; nineteenth-century British and Indian soldiers; and the armies of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. The characters march around in search of other survivors, then clash in epic battle. It's not until the end that the novel returns to the mystery of the tiny, eye-like satellites (and doesn't solve it). In other words, the plot of <i>Time's Eye</i> is a nearly 300-page digression, and <i>2001</i> fans expecting exploration of the scientific enigma and examination of the meaning of existence will be disappointed.

So she bared her teeth in a fighting snarl&#x2014;ï¿½her favorite expression, after all&#x2014;ï¿½pushed up from her knees and went at Brand harder than ever.<br><br>She barged at him with her shoulder, their shields clashing and grating, sand scattering from his heels as he staggered back down the beach, face still twisted with pain. He chopped at her but she ducked his wooden sword, swept hers low and caught him full in the calf, just below his mailshirt&#x2019;s flapping hem.<br><br>To give Brand his due he didn&#x2019;t go down, didn&#x2019;t even cry out, just hopped back, grimacing. Thorn shook her shoulders out, waiting to see if Master Hunnan would call that a win, but he stood silent as the statues in the Godshall.<br><br>Some masters-ï¿½at-ï¿½arms acted as if the practice swords were real, called a halt at what would have been a finishing blow from a steel blade. But Hunnan liked to see his students put down, and hurt, and taught a hard lesson. The gods knew, Thorn had learned hard lessons enough in Hunnan&#x2019;s square. She was happy to teach a few.<br><br>So she gave Brand a mocking smile&#x2014;ï¿½her second favorite expression, after all&#x2014;and screamed, &#x201c;Come on, you coward!&#x201d;<br><br>Brand was strong as a bull, and had plenty of fight in him, but he was limping, and tired, and Thorn had made sure the slope of the beach was on her side. She kept her eyes fixed on him, dodged one blow, and another, then slipped around a clumsy overhead to leave his side open. The best place to sheathe a blade is in your enemy&#x2019;s back, her father always said, but the side was almost as good. Her wooden sword thudded into Brand&#x2019;s ribs with a thwack like a log splitting, left him tottering helpless, and Thorn grinning wider than ever. There&#x2019;s no feeling in the world so sweet as hitting someone just right.<br><br>She planted the sole of her boot on his arse, shoved him splashing down on his hands and knees in the latest wave, and on its hissing way out it caught his sword and washed it down the beach, left it mired among the weeds.<br><br>She stepped close and Brand winced up at her, wet hair plastered to one side of his face and his teeth bloodied from the butt she gave him before. Maybe she should&#x2019;ve felt sorry for him. But it had been a long time since Thorn could afford to feel sorry.<br><br>Instead she pressed her notched wooden blade into his neck and said, &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; He waved her weakly away, hardly able to get the breath to speak. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; she shouted in his face.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; she shouted at the crestfallen lads about the square.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; she shouted at Master Hunnan, and she thrust up her sword and shield in triumph and shook them at the spitting sky.<br><br>A few limp claps and mutters and that was it.

But she had never seen his frown quite so grim. &#x201c;I decide the tests you&#x2019;ll take. I decide when you&#x2019;ve passed.&#x201d; He looked over to the lads her age. The lads of sixteen, some already puffed with pride from passing their own tests. &#x201c;Rauk. You&#x2019;ll fight Thorn next.&#x201d;<br><br>Rauk&#x2019;s brows went up, then he looked at Thorn and shrugged. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he said, and stepped between his fellows into the square, strapping his shield tight and plucking up a practice sword.<br><br>He was a cruel one, and skillful. Not near as strong as Brand but a lot less likely to hesitate. Still, Thorn had beaten him before and she&#x2019;d&#x2014;ï¿½<br><br>&#x201c;Rauk,&#x201d; said Hunnan, his knobble-ï¿½knuckled finger wandering on, &#x201c;and Sordaf, and Edwal.&#x201d;<br><br>The glow of triumph drained from Thorn like the slops from a broken bath. There was a muttering among the lads as Sordaf&#x2014;ï¿½big, slow and with scant imagination, but a hell of a choice for stomping on someone who was down&#x2014;ï¿½lumbered out onto the sand, doing up the buckles on his mail with fat fingers.<br><br>Edwal&#x2014;ï¿½quick and narrow-ï¿½shouldered with a tangle of brown curls&#x2014;ï¿½didn&#x2019;t move right off. Thorn had always thought he was one of the better ones. &#x201c;Master Hunnan, three of us&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you want a place on the king&#x2019;s raid,&#x201d; said Hunnan, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll do as you&#x2019;re bid.&#x201d;<br><br>They all wanted a place. They wanted one almost as much as Thorn did. Edwal frowned left and right, but no one spoke up. Reluctantly he slipped between the others and picked out a wooden sword.<br><br>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t fair.&#x201d; Thorn was used to always wearing a brave face, no matter how long the odds, but her voice then was a desperate bleat. Like a lamb herded helpless to the slaughterman&#x2019;s knife.<br><br>Hunnan dismissed it with a snort. &#x201c;This square is the battlefield, girl, and the battlefield isn&#x2019;t fair. Consider that your last lesson here.&#x201d;<br><br>There were some stray chuckles at that. Probably from some of those she&#x2019;d shamed with beatings one time or another. Brand watched from behind a few loose strands of hair, one hand nursing his bloody mouth. Others kept their eyes to the ground. They all knew it wasn&#x2019;t fair. They didn&#x2019;t care.<br><br>Thorn set her jaw, put her shield hand to the pouch around her neck and squeezed it tight. It had been her against the world for longer than she could remember. If Thorn was one thing, she was a fighter. She&#x2019;d give them a fight they wouldn&#x2019;t soon forget.<br><br>Rauk jerked his head to the others and they began to spread out, aiming to surround her. Might not be the worst thing. If she struck fast enough she could pick one off from the herd, give herself some splinter of a chance against the other two.<br><br>She looked in their eyes, trying to judge what they&#x2019;d do. Edwal reluctant, hanging back. Sordaf watchful, shield up. Rauk letting his sword dangle, showing off to the crowd.<br><br>Just get rid of his smile. Turn that bloody and she&#x2019;d be satisfied.<br><br>His smile buckled when she gave the fighting scream. Rauk caught her first blow on his shield, giving ground, and a second too, splinters flying, then she tricked him with her eyes so he lifted his shield high, went low at the last moment and caught him a scything blow in his hip. He cried out, twisting sideways so the back of his head was to her. She was already lifting her sword again.<br><br>There was a flicker at the corner of her eye and a sick crunch. She hardly felt as if she fell. But suddenly the sand was roughing her up pretty good, then she was staring stupidly at the sky.<br><br>There&#x2019;s your problem with going for one and ignoring the other two.<br><br>Gulls called above, circling.<br><br>The towers of Thorlby cut out black against the bright sky.<br><br>Best get up, her father said. Won&#x2019;t win anything on your back.<br><br>Thorn rolled, lazy, clumsy, pouch slipping from her collar and swinging on its cord, her face one great throb.<br><br>Water surged cold up the beach and around her knees and she saw Sordaf stamp down, heard a crack like a stick breaking.<br><br>She tried to scramble up and Rauk&#x2019;s boot thudded into her ribs and rolled her over, coughing.<br><br>The wave sucked back and sank away, blood tickling at her top lip, dripping pit-ï¿½patter on the wet sand.<br><br>&#x201c;Should we stop?&#x201d; she heard Edwal say.<br><br>&#x201c;Did I say stop?&#x201d; came Hunnan&#x2019;s voice, and Thorn closed her fist tight around the grip of her sword, gathering one more effort.<br><br>She saw Rauk step towards her and she caught his leg as he kicked, hugged it to her chest. She jerked up hard, growling in his face, and he tumbled over backward, arms flailing.<br><br>She tottered at Edwal, more falling than charging, Mother Sea and Father Earth and Hunnan&#x2019;s frown and the faces of the watching lads all tipping and reeling. He caught her, more holding her up than trying to put her down. She grabbed at his shoulder, wrist twisted, sword torn from her hand as she stumbled past, floundering onto her knees and up again, her shield flapping at her side on its torn strap as she turned, spitting and cursing, and froze.<br><br>Sordaf stood, sword dangling limp, staring.<br><br>Rauk lay propped on his elbows on the wet sand, staring.<br><br>Brand stood among the other boys, mouth hanging open, all of them staring.<br><br>Edwal opened his mouth but all that came out was a strange squelch like a fart. He dropped his practice blade and lifted a clumsy hand to paw at his neck.<br><br>The hilt of Thorn&#x2019;s sword was there. The wooden blade had broken to leave a long shard when Sordaf stamped on it. The shard was through Edwal&#x2019;s throat, the point glistening red.<br><br>&#x201c;Gods,&#x201d; someone whispered.<br><br>Edwal slumped down on his knees and drooled bloody froth onto the sand.<br><br>Master Hunnan caught him as he pitched onto his side. Brand and some of the others gathered around them, all shouting over each other. Thorn could hardly pick out the words over the thunder of her own heart.<br><br>She stood swaying, face throbbing, hair torn loose and whipping in her eyes with the wind, wondering if this was all a nightmare. Sure it must be. Praying it might be. She squeezed her eyes shut, squeezed them, squeezed them.<br><br>As she had when they led her to her father&#x2019;s body, white and cold beneath the dome of the Godshall.<br><br>But that had been real, and so was this.<br><br>When she snapped her eyes open the lads were still kneeling around Edwal so all she could see was his limp boots fallen outward. Black streaks came curling down the sand, then Mother Sea sent a wave and turned them red, then pink, then they were washed away and gone.<br><br>And for the first time in a long time Thorn felt truly scared.<br><br>Hunnan slowly stood, slowly turned. He always frowned, hardest of all at her. But there was a brightness in his eyes now she had never seen before.<br><br>&#x201c;Thorn Bathu.&#x201d; He pointed at her with one red finger. &#x201c;I name you a murderer.&#x201d;<br><br>In the Shadows<br><br>&#x201c;Do good,&#x201d; Brand&#x2019;s mother said to him the day she died. &#x201c;Stand in the light.&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d hardly understood what doing good meant at six years old. He wasn&#x2019;t sure he was much closer at sixteen. Here he was, after all, wasting what should have been his proudest moment, still trying to puzzle out the good thing to do.<br><br>It was a high honor to stand guard on the Black Chair. To be accepted as a warrior of Gettland in the sight of gods and men. He&#x2019;d struggled for it, hadn&#x2019;t he? Bled for it? Earned his place? As long as Brand could remember, it had been his dream to stand armed among his brothers on the hallowed stones of the Godshall.<br><br>But he didn&#x2019;t feel like he was standing in the light.<br><br>&#x201c;I worry about this raid on the Islanders,&#x201d; Father Yarvi was saying, bringing the argument in a circle, as ministers always seemed to. &#x201c;The High King has forbidden swords to be drawn. He will take it very ill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The High King forbids everything,&#x201d; said Queen Laithlin, one hand on her child-ï¿½swollen belly, &#x201c;and takes everything ill.&#x201d;<br><br>Beside her, King Uthil shifted forward in the Black Chair. &#x201c;Meanwhile he orders the Islanders and the Vanstermen and any other curs he can bend to his bidding to draw their swords against us.&#x201d;<br><br>A surge of anger passed through the great men and women of Gettland gathered before the dais. A week before Brand&#x2019;s voice would&#x2019;ve been loudest among them.<br><br>But all he could think of now was Edwal with the wooden sword through his neck, drooling red as he made that honking pig sound. The last he&#x2019;d ever make. And Thorn, swaying on the sand with her hair stuck across her blood-ï¿½smeared face, jaw hanging open as Hunnan named her a murderer.<br><br>&#x201c;Two of my ships taken!&#x201d; A merchant&#x2019;s jewelled key bounced on her chest as she shook her fist toward the dais. &#x201c;And not just cargo lost but men dead!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And the Vanstermen have crossed the border again!&#x201d; came a deep shout from the men&#x2019;s side of the hall, &#x201c;and burned steadings and taken good folk of Gettland as slaves!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grom-ï¿½gil-ï¿½Gorm was seen there!&#x201d; someone shouted, and the mere mention of the name filled the dome of the Godshall with muttered curses. &#x201c;The Breaker of Swords himself!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Islanders must pay in blood,&#x201d; growled an old one-ï¿½eyed warrior, &#x201c;then the Vanstermen, and the Breaker of Swords too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course they must!&#x201d; called Yarvi to the grumbling crowd, his shrivelled crab-ï¿½claw of a left hand held up for calm, &#x201c;but when and how is the question. The wise wait for their moment, and we are by no means ready for war with the High King.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One is always ready for war.&#x201d; Uthil gently twisted the pommel of his sword so the naked blade flashed in the gloom. &#x201c;Or never.&#x201d;<br><br>Edwal had always been ready. A man who stood for the man beside him, just as a warrior of Gettland was supposed to. Surely he hadn&#x2019;t deserved to die for that?<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Craeft</h2><p>In the modern world we are becoming bombarded by craft.

Kennedy. Based on extensive research and interviews with Kennedy family members and their intimates speaking on the record for the first time, it offers an outstanding personal history - and provides shocking revelations about one of the most influential figures of our time. To the mythmakers of his day, Joseph P. Kennedy, like his glamorous and doomed presidential son Jack, led a charmed existence. He was celebrated as the son of an East Boston saloonkeeper who rose to become one of the richest men in the country. He served as the wartime ambassador to Great Britain, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and the chairman of the United States Maritime Commission. He was also a major legitimate liquor distributor, a moviemaker in Hollywood, and a master manipulator of the stock market. Yet his fortune, estimated at $100 million, traced its beginnings to his career as a bootlegger in partnership with organized crime during the Prohibition era. Even more disturbing, he was a documented anti-Semite and an appeaser of Adolf Hitler. The beaming family portraits and admiring newsmagazine prose never portrayed any of his many mistresses - or hinted at his seemingly unlimited corruption and duplicity.Ronald Kessler is an award-winning American journalist and author of nine books including the bestseller Inside The White House.</p><h2>War In The West A New History</h2><p>&#39;Ranks as a towering work of historical research and writing&#39; - Nigel Jones, BBC History Magazine In the second volume of his acclaimed new history of the Second World War, James Holland examines the momentous turning points of 1941-1943: Hitler&#39;s invasion of Russia; America&#39;s entry into the conflict; the devastating Thousand Bomber Raids over Germany; the long struggle in the deserts of North Africa; and the defeat of the U-boats in the crucial Battle of the Atlantic. As in his first volume, Germany Ascendant, he interweaves his account of the well-known events of the period with the personal stories of individuals caught up in them - on all sides. Through interviews, letters, diaries and reports, he allows us to see the war not just from the perspective of politicians, military commanders and strategists, but also through the eyes of civilians bombed out of their homes, resistance members stranded in the frozen Norwegian winter, sailors risking their lives in the Atlantic convoys, German aces striving for supremacy in the air, and ordinary soldiers battling for survival in the scorching sands of Libya. He also looks behind the scenes at the all-important `machinery&#39; of war: the manufacturing, farming and vital supply lines that underpinned the entire conflict and ultimately determined its course. From the battle fronts on land, sea and air, to the streets, fields and factories of Britain, America and Germany, he paints a dramatic and compelling portrait of these pivotal years when the tide began to turn. Combining his own research with only recently accessible archive material, Holland looks afresh at this cataclysmic conflict, reassessing long-held views and challenging conventional assumptions. The result is ground-breaking history that redefines the war in the West and makes us think again about the events that shaped our modern world.</p><p>James Holland is a historian, writer and broadcaster. The author of a number of best-selling histories including Battle of Britain and Dam Busters, and, most recently, Burma &#39;44, he has also written nine works of historical fiction, including the Jack Tanner novels.

But just as the Psalmist gained insight into God's character through the observation of nature, modern scientific study can deepen and enrich our vision of the Creator and our place in his creation. In this often contentious field Bishop, Funck, Lewis, Moshier, and Walton serve as our able guides. Based on over two decades of teaching origins together in the classroom, the authors present a textbook exploring mainstream scientific theories of origins in astronomy, cosmology, chemistry, geology, biology, physical anthropology, and genetics. While many authors engage origins from a Christian perspective, this is the first work offering a full-fledged discussion of the scientific narrative of origins from the Big Bang through humankind, from biblical and theological perspectives accessible to a lay audience. Topics include <ul><li>Principles of biblical interpretation</li><li>Close readings of relevant Genesis texts</li><li>A comprehensive Trinitarian doctrine of creation</li><li>Cosmic origins</li><li>The geologic history of Earth</li><li>The origin of life on Earth</li><li>The origin of species and diversity of life</li><li>Human origins</li><li>New creation and creation care</li><li>Science education</li></ul> Rather than the familiar scenario where science and faith compete, this book seeks to diffuse tensions by taking the inspiration and authority of the Bible seriously while respecting and honoring God's revelation through creation. <em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> gives the reader a detailed picture of the sciences of origins along with how they fit into the story of God's creative and redemptive action.</p><p>Robert C. Bishop (PhD, University of Texas) is associate professor of physics and philosophy and the John and Madeleine McIntyre Endowed Professor of Philosophy and History of Science at Wheaton College. His research interests include the physical and social sciences, particularly the implications of science and its assumptions for theories of mind, free will and consciousness. Bishop is the author of <em>The Philosophy of the Social Science</em> and co-editor of <em>Between Chance and Choice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Determinism.</em> Widely published in scientific and religious journals, Bishop is a member of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Scientific Affiliation and the Philosophy of Science Association. He is also the area editor for philosophy of science at the <em>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</em>"<em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> is a groundbreaking book. These engaging, field-tested materials, used over many years by outstanding faculty at a flagship Christian university, are sure to be an important new resource for Christian students. <em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> reflects top-notch scholarship sensitively distilled to an accessible level, and it is uniquely comprehensive in its treatment of data from the physical and biological sciences, as well as philosophy, theology, and biblical studies. <em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> is going to be on my short list of recommended resources in this important area. Highly recommended!" (Jeff Hardin, Raymond E. Keller Professor and Chair of the Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison)<br><br>"<em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> is one of the clearest and most helpful articulations of the discussion on origins. The topics include frameworks for biblical interpretations, descriptions of interpretations by differing Christian traditions, the approaches and types of evidence used across scientific fields, and some of the best contemporary theological work that emphasizes Trinitarian ways of thinking and understanding. This book also draws on the insights of the last several decades of creation care theology. I recommend it for a broad range of audiences both because of its depth of understanding and its accessibility." (Janel Curry, Gordon College)<br><br>"According to the Bible, God created everything&#x2015;the cosmos, the solar system, the earth, and life itself. Many Christians wrongly believe that science undermines that belief and so they avoid, or worse, attack science. <em>Understanding Scientific Theories of Origins</em> is a book that looks at the best mainstream science from a Christian perspective to show that such fears are unfounded. This book, born in the classroom, is a perfect textbook for colleges and also for all Christians who are interested in the question of how the Bible and science relate." (Tremper Longman III, Distinguished Scholar and Professor Emeritus of Biblical Studies, Westmont College)<br><br>"This superbly designed textbook once again shows how foolish it is to think of 'warfare' when considering science in relation to Christian faith. The team of authors includes first-rate scientists and much-respected Bible scholars. <em>Together</em> they explain clearly, patiently, and with accessible language why modern believers have nothing to fear from established scientific research&#x2015;and why orthodox Christian faith has so much to offer in clarifying what scientists discover. It is a book perfect for the classroom, but also full of insight for general readers as well." (Mark Noll, author of The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind, coeditor of B. B. Warfield: Evolution, Science, and Scripture)<br><br>"At a time when the world faces major existential questions including the impact of humans on the environment and the shape of the humanity's future (with the ability to profoundly alter ourselves through various forms of enhancement and gene editing), there is a profound need for faithful, cogent, and sensitive discussions of the relationship between scientific methods, discovery and advancement, and Christian theology. The issues touch on all the academic disciplines in the modern university. Hence, these discussions should begin as a foundation of pedagogical commitments, and to succeed well, ought to be truly interdisciplinary. This is no easy brief to meet and so it is rarely found leaving a yawning gap. This book fills that significant void offering us the benefit of the authors'&#x2015;who represent an important range of disciplines&#x2015;years of classroom, scholarly, and public engagement experience. It justly deserves to become a standard work in college courses seeking to integrate deep reflection on science and Christianity. We will all be the better for it." (Stanley P. Rosenberg, executive director, Scholarship &amp; Christianity in Oxford, Wycliffe Hall and the faculty of theology and religion, University of Oxford)</p><h2>Transforming Leadership: Jesus&#39; Way of Creating Vision, Shaping Values Empowering Change</h2><p>A book for leaders, by leaders, about the greatest leader of them all. In our rapidly changing and ever more complex world, we suffer a crisis of leadership. Leighton Ford sees the growing dearth of bold leaders--in the marketplace, religion and public life. In this powerful book, Ford calls Christians to be transformational leaders. Many leaders work within situations; transformational leaders change situations. Many leaders accept what can be talked about; transformational leaders change what can be talked about. Many leaders talk about payoffs; transformational leaders talk about goals. Many leaders bargain; transformational leaders appeal to a common vision. Ford realizes that desperately needed Christian and transformational leadership will not emerge until we have a model of the transforming leader. And what more powerful example of leadership could there be than Jesus? Insightfully examining Jesus&#39; work and the best recent books on leadership, Ford presents --the leader as strategist --the leader as seer --the leader as seeker --the leader as servant --the leader as struggler --the leader as sustainer Executives, pastors, managers, professionals--all will benefit from this fresh, in-depth treatment by a man who is himself one of the world&#39;s finest Christian leaders.</p><p>Leighton Ford is President of Leighton Ford Ministries, which seeks to help young leaders worldwide to lead more <em>like</em> Jesus and more <em>to</em> Jesus. For many years, Ford communicated Christ around the globe through speaking, writing and media outreach, addressing millions of people in thirty-seven countries on every continent. He served from 1955 until 1985 as Associate Evangelist and later Vice President of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and was featured as the alternate speaker to Billy Graham on the <em>Hour of Decision</em> broadcast. Ford describes his current mission to be "an artist of the soul and a friend on the journey." He served for nearly twenty years as chairman of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, an international body of Christian leaders. He chairs the Sandy Ford Fund and has served as a board member for World Vision U. S., the Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He received the 1990 Two Hungers Award, recognizing his contributions to addressing the physical and spiritual hungers of people around the world. In 1985 he was selected as Clergyman of the Year by Religious Heritage of America and <em>TIME Magazine</em> singled him out as being "among the most influential preachers of an active gospel." The author or co-author of numerous books, including<em>Transforming Leadership</em> and <em>The Attentive Life,</em> Ford lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife Jean.</p><h2>Death from a Top Hat: A Great Merlini Mystery (An American Mystery Classic)</h2><p><p><strong>A detective steeped in the art of magic solves the mystifying murder of two occultists.</strong></p><p>Now retired from the tour circuit on which he made his name, master magician The Great Merlini spends his days running a magic shop in New York&#x2019;s Times Square and his nights moonlighting as a consultant for the NYPD. The cops call him when faced with crimes so impossible that they can only be comprehended by a magician&#x2019;s mind. In the most recent case, two occultists are discovered dead in locked rooms, one spread out on a pentagram, both appearing to have been murdered under similar circumstances. The list of suspects includes an escape artist, a professional medium, and a ventriloquist, so it&#x2019;s clear that the crimes took place in a realm that Merlini knows well. But in the end it will take his logical skills, and not his magical ones, to apprehend the killer.</p><p>Reprinted for the first time in over twenty years, <em>Death from a Top Hat</em> is an ingeniously-plotted puzzle set in the world of New York stage magic, which was at its pinnacle in the early twentieth century. In 1981, the novel was selected as one of the top ten locked room mysteries of all time by a panel of mystery-world luminaries that included Julian Symons, Edward D. Hoch, Ellery Queen&#x2019;s co-creator Frederic Dannay, and Otto Penzler.</p></p><p><p>Clayton Rawson (1906&#x2013;1971) was a novelist, editor, and magician. He is best known for creating the Great Merlini, an illusionist and amateur sleuth introduced in <em>Death from a Top Hat</em> (1938). Rawson followed the character through three more novels, concluding the series with <em>No Coffin for the Corpse</em> (1942). In 1941 and 1943 he published the short-story collections <em>Death out of Thin Air</em> and <em>Death from Nowhere</em>, starring Don Diavolo, an escape artist introduced in the Merlini series.</p><p>Otto Penzler, the creator of American Mystery Classics, is also the founder of the Mysterious Press (1975), a literary crime imprint now associated with Grove/Atlantic; Mysterious Press.com (2011), an electronic-book publishing company; and New York City&#x2019;s Mysterious Bookshop (1979).

Born to Dance: The Story of Jose Limon</h2><p>Josï¿½ was a boy with a song in his heart and a dance in his step. Born in Mexico in 1908, he came into the world kicking like a steer, and grew up to love to draw, play the piano, and dream. Josï¿½'s dreaming took him to faraway places. He dreamed of bullfighters and the sounds of the cancan dancers that he saw with his father. Dance lit a fire in Josï¿½'s soul. <br> With his heart to guide him, Josï¿½ left his family and went to New York to dance. He learned to flow and float and fly through space with steps like a Mexican breeze. When Josï¿½ danced, his spirit soared. From New York to lands afar, Josï¿½ Limï¿½n became known as the man who gave the world his own kind of dance. <br> ï¿½OLï¿½! ï¿½OLï¿½! ï¿½OLï¿½! <br> Susanna Reich's lyrical text and Raï¿½l Colï¿½n's shimmering artwork tell the story of a boy who was determined to make a difference in the world, and did.

Mr. Colï¿½n lived in Puerto Rico as a young boy and now resides in New City, New York, with his family.Grade 2-4&#x2013;This story of a young Mexican boy with dreams works better as a picture book than a true biography. Brief anecdotes, presented like a slide show, take readers from Limï¿½n's birth through a happy childhood, the Mexican civil war, immigration and adaptation to the United States, and his struggle to become a painter, and then a dancer, in New York City. Colï¿½n's watercolor and colored-pencil illustrations on textured paper give a sense of movement and life. Colors are muted, backgrounds are somewhat impressionistic, and there is more energy in the art than in the very simple text. Short sentences, Spanish words scattered about (defined both in context and in a brief glossary on the copyright page), and some rhythm and sound effects make this a good read-aloud, though the lack of emotion at such pivotal moments as the outbreak of war, a mother's death, and Limï¿½n's leaving his elderly father for New York, is a weakness. The book gives little sense of the importance of Limï¿½n's life as a dancer and choreographer, and his transition from struggling painter to successful dancer is oddly abrupt. A historical note addresses his adult life and impact on dance history. Use this as a story or to pique the interest of children in this artist, but not as a biography.<i>&#x2013;Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her past was a road map to prove it. But on this particular Friday in the first week of November, she experienced one of those dï¿½jï¿½ vu moments as the Good Lord hit Rewind on the story that was her life.</p> <p>She was sweeping the front sidewalk of Phillips' Pharmacy, where she worked, when she heard the low, sexy rumble of a hot-rod engine. The skin crawled on the back of her neck as a shiny black pickup truck went rumbling down Main Street.</p> <p>Before she could see the driver, sunlight hit the windshield, reflecting directly into her eyes. At the same time she went blind, she heard him rack the pipes on the muffler, just like Randy Joe used to do when he picked her up for their Saturday night date. But that was a long time ago, before he went away to war in Afghanistan and got himself killed.</p> <p>She had no idea who was driving this truck, and when she looked again, it was turning the corner at the far end of the street and then it was out of sight.</p> <p>For LilyAnn, seeing that truck and hearing the pipes rattle felt like a sign. Was it the universe telling her she was living in the past? Because if it was, she already knew that. Or was it Randy Joe sending her a message, and if it was, what was he trying to say?</p> <p>As she resumed sweeping, a car drove up and parked in front of Dalton's Fitness Center next door. It was Rachel Goodhope, who ran the local bed and breakfast in Blessings. She got out wearing her workout clothes and waved at Lily as she ran inside.</p> <p>Lily eyed the woman's big boobs and toned body and began sweeping in earnest. Rachel looked good for a woman in her late forties, and everyone knew she liked to stay fit. She was on her third husband, and there was talk he might be getting the boot before long. No one could actually put their finger on what the problem was with Rachel and her marriages. Some said it had to do with her choice of men, while others hinted that Rachel would be a hard woman to please. Still, she obviously saw the need to stay fit in case she was ever in the market for husband number four.</p> <p>Lily was of the opinion that any woman with a backbone and the nerve to speak her mind should be difficult to please. Her great-great-grandma, Delia Bronte, had put a musket ball through a Yankee captain's hat during the War of Northern Aggression because he had not taken it off his head when he forced his way into her house. Lily liked to think she had a little bit of that in her, as well.</p> <p>Just thinking about that Yankee intruder and her great-great-grandma's gumption made her push the broom a little harder across the sidewalk. But seeing that truck had set her to thinking about the past, and before she knew it, she was knee-deep in memories long since gone.</p> <p>***</p> <p>LilyAnn had been a constant source of pride for her parents through all her growing-up years. When she reached high school, she lost her braces and grew boobs, hitting her stride with a bang. She became an honor student, a high school cheerleader, and was voted prettiest and friendliest every year by her class. When she was chosen head cheerleader her senior year, Randy Joe Bentonfield, the star quarterback, also chose her for his steady girl. She was over the moon, and her parents rejoiced in the moments in which she excelled.</p> <p>As the year progressed, she marked another milestone by being named homecoming queen, then another when the announcement was made that she would be the valedictorian of her high school graduating class-two more notches in a high school career on a fast track to success.</p> <p>But it wasn't until she won the title of the Peachy-Keen Queen that her parents broke out in full braggadocio. Lily felt as if her life could not get any better. But as the old saying goes, once you've reached the top, the only place to go is downhill.</p> <p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, two planes flew into the World Trade Center in New York City and another one into the Pentagon. When the fourth one was taken down by the plane's passengers, crashing into a cornfield killing all on board, the world suddenly stopped turning on LilyAnn's axis. It was no longer about her.</p> <p>National outrage followed the shock as young men and women from all over the country began enlisting in the army, including a lot of the young men in Blessings.</p> <p>Randy Joe was one of the first to sign up. She cried herself silly, after which they made love. Randy Joe was so full of himself about being a man going away to war that he gave her a promise ring before he went away to boot camp. He came back long enough to have his picture taken in his uniform and then he shipped out, returning a month later in a flag-draped casket.</p> <p>People said it had been a good thing he'd had that picture taken beforehand because he'd come back to Blessings in pieces, no longer fit for viewing.</p> <p>His death devastated Lily, but at the same time, it thrust her back into the spotlight. Now she had a new status-the almost fiancï¿½e of Blessings' first war casualty. She dropped out of college that year and wore black, which went really well with her long blond hair. She visited his grave site every day for a year, and people said what a faithful young woman she was, grieving for her lost love in such a fashion.</p> <p>When a new semester of college rolled around, she didn't go back. She was still paying visits to the cemetery, although as time between visits lengthened to weekly, then monthly, people still commented that LilyAnn was such a sweet thing to remember her dearly departed in such faithful ways. And because she'd lost her way and didn't know how to move past her first love or the success of her prior milestones, she took the mantle of bereavement to a whole new level.</p> <p>One year turned into two and then three, and going to college was something other people did as everything became a blur. Her daddy had a heart attack and died, which turned her mama into a widow, and Lily barely remembered her dreams for the future and had forgotten how to get there.</p> <p>The worst were the times when she could no longer bring Randy Joe's face to mind. At that point, the guilt would set her to eating a whole pint of chocolate-chip ice cream, just because it was his favorite treat. It didn't revive her memory or renew her desire to move on, but it did pack on the pounds.</p> <p>The years came and went without notice until Lily was eleven years lost. Now she only visited his grave when she thought about it and had unwittingly masked her emotions with a bulwark of extra weight.</p> <p>She had no status in Blessings beyond being one of two clerks at Phillips' Pharmacy and the daughter of Grace Bronte, the widow who married a man twelve years her junior whom she met on an online dating site and proved all her critics wrong by living happily ever after in Miami, Florida.</p> <p>Between the loss of Randy Joe and the abdication of her only living parent, LilyAnn had lost her way. She was stuck in a rut: too afraid to step out for fear of getting too close to someone and getting left behind all over again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>At least, that's how Lily had felt, until today when the sun got in her eyes and she'd heard the rattle of those pipes. She felt off-center, like she was trying to balance on one leg, and became convinced that truck was an omen of great change.</p> <p>As soon as she finished sweeping, she went inside and began her day. Today was Friday, which meant she would get her hair done during her lunch hour. But she had to wait for Mitchell Avery, the other pharmacy clerk, and couldn't leave until he arrived.</p> <p>When Mitchell finally clocked in less than five minutes under the wire, she grabbed her jacket, turned the key to the cash register over to Mitchell, and headed out the door.</p> <p>The sun was directly overhead, and the morning breeze had quickened to a stiff wind. She shivered, wishing she would have worn a heavier jacket. She caught a glimpse of herself in the plate glass windows of Dalton's Fitness Center and then quickly looked away. It was always a shock to see what she looked like now. She didn't feel like a big girl, but she was one. She quickened her step, suddenly anxious to get off the street, out of sight and judgment.</p> <p>When she reached The Curl Up and Dye, she was relieved. This was a safe place, a place where people came to get pretty. If only there was a place where people could go to get their lives back, she'd be the first standing in line.</p> <p>The bell over the door jingled as she walked inside. The owner, Ruby Dye, who everyone called Sister, was already smiling, which prompted Lily to smile back.</p> <p>"Hey, LilyAnn. How's it going, honey? Boy, that wind is sharp today, isn't it?"</p> <p>Lily nodded as she hung up her jacket. "Yes, it's getting cold. I sure hate to see winter coming."</p> <p>"I kind of like it," Ruby said. "The short days and long nights give me time to den up with a good book and some popcorn, or watch old movies on the cable channel."</p> <p>The last thing Lily needed was more time to eat through the loneliness.</p> <p>"I guess," she said, as she sat down at the shampoo station.</p> <p>As soon as Ruby put the cape around her neck, Lily leaned her head back in the sink and closed her eyes. Getting her long blond hair washed by someone else was pure luxury. When Ruby began scrubbing and massaging Lily's scalp, the tension in her shoulders began to ease. By the time they were through and she was back in the stylist chair, Lily was two shades shy of having been put into a trance.</p> <p>Ruby eyed the young woman, watching the way Lily looked everywhere but in the mirror at herself. If only there was a way to get her out of the rut she was in.</p> <p>Ruby's eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she combed some styling gel into Lily's wet hair and then reached for the blow-dryer.</p> <p>"I don't suppose you're interested in a new hairstyle?" Ruby asked.</p> <p>Lily frowned. "I wouldn't know what to do with it."</p> <p>"No matter. One of these days we'll figure something out," Ruby said.</p> <p>Her thumb was on the Power button when they all heard the sound of a hot rod passing by. Whatever the driver had done to that engine, it rumbled like a stereo with the bass set on high.</p> <p>Lily's eyes widened. It had to be the driver with the truck like Randy Joe's. She swiveled her chair around so fast to get a look that Ruby got the round brush tangled up in her hair.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. Did that pull?" Ruby asked, as she began trying to unwind it.</p> <p>Lily was oblivious. "No, no, it didn't hurt," she muttered, still craning her neck to see the driver.</p> <p>And then to everyone's surprise, the truck pulled up to the curb in front of the salon and parked, the driver racking the pipes one last time before killing the engine.</p> <p>Vesta and Vera Conklin, the twin fortysomething hairstylists, had been eating their lunch in the break room and came out to see what the noise was all about.</p> <p>Mabel Jean Doolittle was the manicurist, a little blond with a scar on her forehead from having gone through the windshield of her boyfriend's car. She called it her reminder to never date anyone that stupid again.</p> <p>She was finishing off a polish for Willa Dean Miller, who ran the local travel agency, and all the women in the shop turned to look as the driver walked in.</p> <p>He was a thirtysomething hunk in a tight, long-sleeved T-shirt tucked into a pair of fitted Wrangler jeans. He had wide shoulders, long legs, slim hips, and a face bordering on cute rather than handsome, but he was working with what he had just fine.</p> <p>He immediately swept the dove-gray Stetson from his head, revealing dark wavy hair, and smiled at the room like a star granting an audience to his fans.</p> <p>Even though Vesta had yet to meet a man worth her time, she wasn't yet dead and buried. She handed Vera her bowl of salad and scooted toward the counter.</p> <p>"Welcome to The Curl Up and Dye. Can I help you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I sure hope so, darlin'. My name is T. J. Lachlan and I'm new in town. I inherited the old Bissler house from my great-uncle Gene and am staying there while I'm fixing it up to sell. I came in to get a haircut and learned the local barber is in the hospital. When I saw your Walk-Ins Welcome sign, I wondered if I might trouble one of you fine ladies for a trim."</p> <p>"Sure, I have time," Vesta said.</p> <p>Vera glared at her sister, then smirked. "No you don't, Vesta. Sue Beamon is due any minute." She set the bowls with their food back in the break room and sauntered to the front of the store and introduced herself.</p> <p>"Welcome to Blessings, Mr. Lachlan. My name is Vera, and I'd be happy to cut your hair."</p> <p>"Y'all can call me T. J., and isn't this something. Excuse me for saying this, but twins are truly a man's finest fancy," he said, and then flashed them both a wide grin.</p> <p>They didn't know whether to be insulted or impressed by the sexual inference, and Ruby could see it was about to get out of hand.</p> <p>"Vesta, there comes Sue, so Vera can pick up the walk-in. Welcome to Blessings, T. J. Take a seat and we'll get you fixed right up."</p> <p>She arched an eyebrow at the twins as a reminder that this was a place of business, then turned Lily's chair around and the blow-dryer back on. Because LilyAnn's hair was so long, it always took a while to dry. She began working the round vent brush through the lengths while keeping an eye on the clock. Lily only had a limited amount of time, and Ruby didn't want to make her late.</p> <p>It wasn't until she was about through that she realized Lily was staring at the stranger as if she'd seen a ghost.</p> <p>Ruby paused. "Hey. Are you okay?" she whispered.</p> <p>Lily blinked, and when she met Ruby's gaze in the mirror, her eyes were filled with tears.</p> <p>"I'm fine, Sister. He just reminded me of someone." Then she shook her head and looked away.</p> <p>Ruby's eyes narrowed. This was the first time she could remember the woman even showing an interest in another man. Even if it was a negative interest, it was better than nothing.</p> <p>"How about we do something a little different with your hair? Maybe pull the sides away from your face and fasten them up here at the crown... or maybe at the nape of your neck? Hmm? What do you think?"</p> <p>She pulled the sides back and held them up at the crown to show Lily what she was talking about.</p> <p>Lily frowned. Pulling her hair away from her face like that only emphasized her double chin.</p> <p>"I don't know. I guess," she muttered.</p> <p>"Good," Ruby said. "A little change never hurt anyone."</p> <p>With an eye still on the clock, she quickly finished Lily's new look.</p> <p>"There you go. Look how pretty you look like this, and just in time to get back to work before Mr. Phillips can complain."</p> <p>Lily frowned again. She felt naked-like she'd revealed too much of herself. She didn't much like it, but it was too late to change it. She slipped into her jacket and grabbed her purse before scuttling toward the front like a crab going sideways across a beach. Her head was down and her shoulders slumped, operating on the theory that if she couldn't see the hunk, then he couldn't see her.</p> <p>"Same time next week," she said, as she ...</p></p><h2>All the Fierce Tethers</h2><p>Readers familiar with Lia Purpura's highly praised essay collections&#x2015;Increase, On Looking, and Rough Likeness&#x2015;will know she's a master of observation, a writer obsessed with the interplay between humans and the things they see. The subject matter of All the Fierce Tethers is wonderfully varied, both low (muskrats, slugs, a stained quilt in a motel room) and lofty (shadows, prayer, the idea of beauty). In "Treatise Against Irony," she counters this all-too modern affliction with ferocious optimism and intelligence: "The opposite of irony is nakedness." In "My Eagles," our nation's symbol is viewed from all angles&#x2015;nesting, flying, politicized, preserved. The essay in itself could be a small anthology. And, in a fresh move, Purpura turns to her own, racially divided Baltimore neighborhood, where a blood stain appears on a street separating East (with its Value Village) and West (with its community garden). Finalist for the National Book Critics Award, winner of a Guggenheim, NEA and four Pushcart Prizes, Lia Purpura returns with a collection both sustaining and challenging.</p><p>Lia Purpura&nbsp;is the author of eight collections of essays, poems, and translations, most recently a collection of poems,&nbsp;It Shouldn&#x2019;t Have Been Beautiful&nbsp;(Penguin).&nbsp;On Looking&nbsp;(essays, Sarabande Books) was finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

This act is almost a kind of denial of writing &#x2015; metaphor, simile, and even cliche are the tools we habitually use to make our observations comprehensible. But Purpura distrusts such simplification, such habits. 'A word is a way to speak about something that really, in truth, no word can touch,' she wrote in her 2011 essay collection, Rough Likeness.

Under her gaze, the most ordinary things become not just extraordinary, but almost frighteningly radiant.

Only a writer of rigor and depth could turn such a shining statement on its head&#x2015;and still manage to delight. <i>All the Fierce Tethers</i> is a phenomenal achievement of art and mind, but it's more than that, really: it will make you feel alive.&#x201d; <br><br><b>&#x2015;Paul Lisicky, author of <i>The Narrow Door: A Memoir of Friendship</i></b><br> &#x201c;Lia Purpura&#x2019;s essays make the tethers between apparently separate things not only visible, but luminous.

Minucius Felix: Octavius (Loeb Classical Library No. 250) (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p><p>The African Q. Septimus Florens Tertullianus (ca. 150&#x2013;222 CE), the great Christian writer, was born a soldier's son at Carthage, educated in Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and medicine, studied law and became a pleader, remaining a clever and often tortuous arguer. At Rome he became a learned and militant Christian. After a visit to churches in Greece (and Asia Minor?) he returned to Carthage and in his writings there founded a Christian Latin language and literature, toiling to fuse enthusiasm with reason; to unite the demands of the Bible with the practice of the Church; and to continue to vindicate the Church's possession of the true doctrine in the face of unbelievers, Jews, Gnostics, and others. In some of his many works he defended Christianity, in others he attacked heretical people and beliefs; in others he dealt with morals. In this volume we present <i>Apologeticus</i> and <i>De Spectaculis.</i></p><p>Of Minucius, an early Christian writer of unknown date, we have only <i>Octavius</i>, a vigorous and readable debate between an unbeliever and a Christian friend of Minucius, Octavius Ianuarius, a lawyer sitting on the seashore at Ostia. Minucius himself acts as presiding judge. Octavius wins the argument. The whole work presents a picture of social and religious conditions in Rome, apparently about the end of the second century.</p></p><p><p>Terrot Reaveley Glover (1869&#x2013;1943) was Fellow and Lecturer in Classics at St John&#x2019;s College, University of Cambridge.</p><p>Gerald Henry Rendall (1851&#x2013;1945) was Gladstone Professor of Greek at the University of Liverpool and Headmaster of Charterhouse School.</p></p><h2>Jeremiah, Lamentations (The NIV Application Commentary)</h2><p>The books of Jeremiah and Lamentations cannot be separated from the political conditions of ancient Judah. Beginning with the righteous king Josiah, who ushered in a time of glorious but brief religious reform, Jeremiah reflects the close tie between spiritual and political prosperity or disaster, between the actions and heart of Judah and her kings and their fortunes as a nation.While few of us today have any firsthand understanding of what it means to live in a theocracy, the central theme of Jeremiah and Lamentations remains clear and still holds true: God first, politics second. The words, prayers, and poems of "the weeping prophet" serve to realign us with God&#x2019;s priorities, turning us from evil and encouraging us to pursue God and his ways. With emotion and spiritual depth, these prophetic writings beckon us toward a spiritual integrity that can still affect the course of individuals and nations today.Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. They focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#x2019;t discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable--but the job is only half done!The NIV Application Commentary Series helps bring both halves of the interpretive task together. This unique, award-winning series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into our postmodern context. It explains not only what the Bible meant but also how it speaks powerfully today.</p><p>J.

Paul Glynn told the powerful story of Dr. Nagai, a Christian convert of remarkable courage and compassion who ministered to the many victims of the atomic bomb attack, <i>The Smile of a Ragpicker</i> brings us the heroic and moving story of Satoko Kitahara, a young, beautiful woman of wealth who gave up her riches and comfort to became one with the ragpickers. She plunged into the life of the poor, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>In nine remarkable years at Sumida Park in Tokyo, Satoko showed through her Christian commitment and serenity how the lives of so many people could be changed by one person. Importantly, she helped the poor recover their self respect and dignity.</p><p>In finding Christ, Satoko found herself. The journey was not easy but her strong new Christian faith assured her that Christ would be with her. Like many of the saints, Satoko experienced the &#x201c;dark night of the soul&#x201d;. A restless young rich woman, she was led by the Holy Spirit to forget her reservations and pride and live with the poorest of the poor. The Lord heard the cry of the poor, and He sent them Satoko. She became known as &#x201c;Ari no Machi no Maria&#x201d;&#x2015;Mary of Ants Town. She inspired all those she touched.</p><p>Every day Satoko encountered Christ in some new and challenging way. She was calling the Church back to identification with the poor. She showed the strength of her internal faith. Like Dr. Nagai, she expressed her faith through the sensitivity and beauty of her own culture. Satoko died a young woman, in dire poverty in a Tokyo slum. Yet her death, mourned by many thousands, reflected her triumphant life of deep Christian faith and charity.</p><p>This book is a powerful story of reconciliation, not between countries, but between people of different social, economic and religious backgrounds, inspired by a frail young woman of luminous faith. <b>Illustrated with photos</b>.</p></p><p><b>Fr.

In today's pluralistic, postsecular world, universal values are dismissed as mere matters of private opinion, and the question of what constitutes flourishing life--for ourselves, our neighbors, and the planet as a whole--is neglected in our universities, our churches, and our culture at large. Although we increasingly have technology to do almost anything, we have little sense of what is truly worth accomplishing.<br><br>In this provocative new contribution to public theology, world-renowned theologian Miroslav Volf (named "America's New Public Intellectual" by Scot McKnight on his <i>Jesus Creed</i> blog) and Matthew Croasmun explain that the intellectual tools needed to rescue us from our present malaise and meet our new cultural challenge are the tools of theology. A renewal of theology is crucial to help us articulate compelling visions of the good life, find our way through the maze of contested questions of value, and answer the fundamental question of what makes life worth living.</p><p><b>"Articulate[s] with breathtaking clarity the urgency and weight of genuine theology"<br></b><br>"<i>For the Life of the World </i>is the perfect riposte both to critics like Richard Dawkins who say that Christian theology is good for nothing and to theologians who are so focused on God that they overlook the world. Volf and Croasmun argue that theology makes a difference precisely because it is about human flourishing. This is a brave and bracing proposal to rethink theology's role and relevance by recovering its original concern with the fundamental question of human existence: How do we live a flourishing life with others in this world, the home of God?"<br>--<b>Kevin&nbsp;J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"This fascinating 'manifesto' reminds us all that theology can only matter if it <i>engages</i> what matters. While their book is directed to theologians, it asks questions so fundamental to human life, and in language so ordinary and pellucid, that many people who are not at all theologians may find themselves caught up in this text. Which is, of course, their point. Highly recommended."<br>--<b>Charles Mathewes</b>, University of Virginia<br><br>"Volf and Croasmun articulate with breathtaking clarity the urgency and weight of genuine theology. Our world's skepticism about the reality of transcendence makes theological work more important even as it becomes less prestigious. This is can't-miss reading."<br>--<b>John Ortberg</b>, senior pastor, Menlo Church; author of <i>I'd Like You More If You Were More Like Me</i><br><br>"This is a timely work with which theologians across the spectrum need to contend--and there will be some contention. Volf and Croasmun mince no words in calling contemporary theologians to task for neglecting to offer theology that matters for the world. They want to persuade us that theologians have a calling to fulfill and they want to see theologians begin to fulfill this calling, now. Along the way they offer incisive analysis on how the conditions of contemporary Western culture affect our lives, our universities, our churches, our very ability to find meaning. I would have loved to have a book like this to expand my imagination for what theology could be as I was first discovering theology; I'm grateful to have it now."<br>--<b>Kristen Johnson</b>, Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan"In this timely and compelling book, Volf and Croasmun issue a clarion call for theologians, broadly understood, to articulate and live into a theology focused on how as humans we might cultivate forms of flourishing life as revealed in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The book recovers an ancient vision of theology as a way of life while being attentive to the internal and external challenges theology must address if it is to declare good news to the contemporary context."<br>--<b>Luke Bretherton</b>, Kenan Institute for Ethics, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"Does anyone listen to theologians anymore? Theology is in something of a crisis with a dwindling audience and a reputation for irrelevance, both inside and outside the church, yet the church (and perhaps even the world) cannot survive long without theology. In this book, Volf and Croasmun make a bold and compelling proposal for a reorientation of the theological task to refocus it around articulating a Christian vision of flourishing life. This is a vitally important book for anyone interested in and committed to the future of theology, done for the sake of the church--and the world."<br>--<b>Graham Tomlin</b>, Bishop of Kensington; president, St.&nbsp;Mellitus College<br><br>"The vision for theology presented here is simple but not easy. Volf and Croasmun think our task as theologians is to be about the flourishing not only of the academy or the church but also of all peoples. Their work is tested in the hard laboratory of professors' classrooms and church planters' living rooms. I challenge you to read this book and not come away encouraged, enlightened, and renewed for our task of contemplating God for the good of humanity. So much of what passes for theology dies in intramural food fights and name calling. This book calls us to a task more urgent, more dangerous, and more life-giving by far than that."<br>--<b>Jason Byassee</b>, Vancouver School of Theology; author, most recently, of <i>Psalms 101-150</i> (Brazos Press)</p><h2>The Daltons Always on the Run (Lucky Luke)</h2><p>A general amnesty puts the Daltons back on the streets, something Lucky Luke isn&#x2019;t happy about.

Not since debates over nuclear warfare has American military strategy been the subject of discussion in living rooms, classrooms, and houses of worship. Yet as this groundbreaking new work shows, the full implications of drones have barely been addressed in the recent media storm.<br> <br>In a unique take on a subject that has grabbed headlines and is consuming billions of taxpayer dollars each year, philosopher Grï¿½goire Chamayou applies the lens of philosophy to our understanding of how drones are changing our world. For the first time in history, a state has claimed the right to wage war across a mobile battlefield that potentially spans the globe. Remote-control flying weapons, he argues, take us well beyond even George W. Bush&#x2019;s justification for the war on terror.<br> <br>What we are seeing is a fundamental transformation of the laws of war that have defined military conflict as between combatants. As more and more drones are launched into battle, war now has the potential to transform into a realm of secretive, targeted assassinations of individuals&#x2014;beyond the view and control not only of potential enemies but also of citizens of democracies themselves. Far more than a simple technology, Chamayou shows, drones are profoundly influencing what it means for a democracy to wage war. <i>A Theory of the Drone</i> will be essential reading for all who care about this important question.<br></p><p><b>Grï¿½goire Chamayou</b> is a research scholar in philosophy at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. The author of <i>Manhunts: A Philosophical History</i>, he lives in Paris. <b>Janet Lloyd</b> has translated more than seventy books from the French by authors such as Jean-Pierre Vernant, Marcel Detienne, and Philippe Descola.<b>Praise for <i>Manhunts</i>, Chamayou's previous book</b>:<br>"<i>Manhunts</i> is an unusual and stimulating essay. . . . The strength of the book lies in its refusal to treat manhunting as a metaphor. Chamayou instead focuses on the concrete violence of predation, tracking, banishment, captivity, confinement, and the murderousness that goes along with them."<br> Jean Berard, <i>Books and Ideas</i> <br> <br>"'Man, wolf to man? Brecht asked the question, Chamayou provides a brilliant and terrifying answer."<br> Mike Davis, author of <i>City of Quartz</i> and <i>Planet of Slums</i> <br> <br>"From manhunting for sport in the Occident to the global search for illegal aliens in the twenty-first century, this book offers a history of humans preying on other human beings. Applying the rubric of hunting to contemporary debates about illegal migrants, Chamayou shows that the supposedly newest hunt refreshes an old motif. A provocative take on a topic of great currency."<br> Jimmy Casas Klausen, University of Wisconsin-Madison<br> <br>"In Chamayou&#x2019;s razor-sharp telling, drones fundamentally transform the psychic, moral, and physical space and art of killing. But it is his theory of the drone that is even more chilling. It demands that we consider the emergence of a new ethical and political norm of war that is neither war as we know it nor peace. The principle of immunity for the imperial combatant&#x2019; rests on a twisted logic: On the one hand is the achieved capacity of the drone operative (one of many newly installed masters of lethal surveillance&#x2019;) to move throughout a day between killing fields and coffee breaks, between combat zones and home. On the other hand is the enlisting of a citizenry to accept the moral obligation&#x2019; to kill. In this compelling analysis, Amnesty International&#x2019;s classing of drone strikes as war crimes would be only part of the story. Chamayou&#x2019;s critical point is that drones alter the very terrain and logic of who deserves to die and implicates us all."<br> Ann Stoler, Willy Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Anthropology, New School for Social Research<br> <br>"A virtuoso performance: a wholly original, wide-ranging, and provocative critique of targeted killing from remote platforms that switches from the big picture&#x2019; to the detailed view with consummate skill and successfully calls into question many of the central claims advanced by the proponents of later modern war."<br> Derek Gregory, Peter Wall Distinguished Professor, University of British Columbia<br> <br>"Chamayou is brilliant. He jumps breezily from Freud and Camus to Marx and Mao, from Israeli and ancient Athenian generals to Russian researchers and Chinese strategists. If you stick with the wild ride, you&#x2019;ll find his arguments are breathtakingly profound and the translation is superb. Chamayou is masterful at unmasking just how ethically bankrupt and dangerous it is to kill people by remote control."<br> Medea Benjamin, cofounder of CODEPINK and author of <i>Drone Warfare</i> <br></p><h2>Prima Facie: A Crime Novella of the Roman Empire (Gaius Petreius Ruso)</h2><p><b>A novella from the author of bestseller <i>Medicus,</i> featuring reluctant investigator Ruso and his partner Tilla.

The essays address early medieval developments, encompassing such seminal issues as the common-law mind of the sixteenth century under the Tudor monarchs, the struggle for power and authority between the Stuart kings and Parliament in the seventeenth century, and the role of the ancient constitution in the momentous legal and constitutional debate that occurred between the Glorious Revolution and the American Declaration of Independence.</p> <p><strong>Ellis Sandoz</strong> is Professor of Political Science and Director of the Eric Voegelin Institute at Louisiana State University.</p></p><p>In this important contribution to the ongoing debate over the origins of constitutionalism and the American republic, Ellis Sandoz brings together the eminent scholars J. C. Holt, Christopher W. Brooks, Paul Christianson, and John Phillip Reid to present a powerful re-evaluation of the place of Magna Carta and the ancient constitution in the tradition of Anglo-American liberty and rule of law. In stark contrast to the Bernard Bailyn-Gordon Wood school of interpretation, which stresses the essentially fungible and evanescent nature of liberty, The Roots of Liberty argues for a far more ancient and substantive paternity. The authors present compelling evidence that our modern-day understanding of liberty under law, commonly traced to seventeenth-century English and eighteenth-century American roots, can in fact be traced back to the depths of English constitutional and political history. The book establishes the place of Magna Carta and the ancient constitution in forming the fabric of law and government from the thirteenth century onward. The essays deal with early medieval developments, with the common law mind of the sixteenth century under the Tudor monarchs, with the struggle for power and authority between the Stuart kings and parliament in the seventeenth century, and with the role of the ancient constitution in the momentous legal and constitutional debates that occurred between the Glorious Revolution and the American Declaration of Independence. Sandoz&#39;s Introduction presents in detail Sir John Fortescue&#39;s vision of the Lancastrian constitution as it was revived by Sir Edward Coke two centuries later to become the centerpiece modern and rule of law. Sandoz also places each ofthe essays into the context of the historiographic debate occasioned by publication of J. G. A. Pocock&#39;s The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law over three decades ago. Corinne C. Weston&#39;s spirited Epilogue evaluates the contributors&#39; arguments and, by way of conclusion, offers its own perspective on the importance of the roots of liberty and origins of rule of law in the Anglo-American tradition. The Roots of Liberty is a valuable addition to our contemporary understanding of the origins and texture of the republican synthesis. For students and scholars of law, history, philosophy, and political science, it is a major contribution to the intellectual history of liberty.Edited and introduced by Sandoz (political science, Louisiana State U.), this volume collects four essays examining the roots and evolution of the idea of liberty in Anglo-American constitutionalism and law. Topics include the significance of the Magna Carta for English constitutionalism; the "ancient constitution" and the sources of the common law jurisprudence of Sir Edward Coke (1552-1634), the traditions of constitutional discourse involved in the 17th century struggle between the English Parliament and the English Crown, and the manifestations of common law and ancient constitutionalism in legal thought from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the founding of the United States. This is a paperbound edition of a work first published in 1993. <br><br><b><i>Reference &amp; Research Book News <br></i></b>August 2008</p><h2>Death at Buckingham Palace: Her Majesty Investigates</h2><p>Jane Bee came to Europe for adventure, only to end up with the job of a lifetime: housemaid at Buckingham Palace. Now her greatest challenge is removing gum from State Room carpets&#x2014;until she comes across a nasty accident right outside the Royal Apartments. The Queen herself has literally stumbled across the dead body of Jane&#x2019;s good friend, footman and aspiring actor Robin Tukes, in what appears to be a suicide.<br><br> But why would handsome, impetuous Robin, having just toasted his engagement to a gorgeous housemaid, not to mention his impending fatherhood, want to die? Buck House buzzes, but only Jane, and the Royal Personage known belowstairs as &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; suspect foul play. At Her Majesty&#x2019;s behest, Jane launches a discreet inquiry that takes her from the Servants&#x2019; Hall to the highest echelons of the Palace. Yet the more Jane uncovers, the clearer it becomes that this latest royal scandal is a real killer.</p><p><b>C. C. Benison</b>&nbsp;is the nom de plume of Doug Whiteway.

As an independent writer, he has contributed to numerous magazines, newspapers, and corporate communications. He also writes award-winning mystery novels and lives in Winnipeg, Canada.When Jane Bee ends up at her aunt's in London, having exhausted her money while traveling through Europe, she's not sure what she'll do next. She hadn't thought it would be as housemaid in the Royal Palace. Polishing the china and sweeping the floors-however royal-isn't much fun, but Jane likes the people and even talks to the Queen, who enlists her help when a footman apparently commits suicide in the Royal Apartments. Of course, it's not quite so simple. Devoted fans of Buckingham Palace may find this amusing, but as a mystery, it's a disappointment. Jane is a rather obvious sleuth, and the Royal revelations she uncovers aren't as scandalous as the real thing. And Jane, as the first-person narrator, becomes annoying, with cutesy comments like "Mother, of course, that is to say, the Queen, is still doing the queen thing: signing legislation, opening Parliament, entertaining Heads of State." <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rad Dad: Dispatches from the Frontiers of Fatherhood</h2><p><p>Combining the best of the award-winning magazine <i>Rad Dad</i> and the Daddy Dialectic blog,&nbsp;this compilation features the best essays written for fathers by a multitude of dads from different walks of life.

E. Brock (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>By the author of <b>The Secret Garden</b>, the 1886 story of a curly-haired American boy who suddenly discovers he is the grandson of an English earl.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesLittle Lord Fauntleroy is the engaging, amusing, and moving story of a boy living on the edge of poverty in New York, who suddenly learns that he is the heir to an English lord with vast lands and wealth. Travelling to his grandfather&#39;s castle, Cedric shows his trusting and democratic nature in his dealings with lawyers and clergymen, servants and farmers, but it is his relationship with his proud and unfeeling grandfather which lies at the heart of the novel, and developments there take an unexpected turn when the appearance of an unforeseen rival claimant to the title brings the book to a dramatic climax. First published in 1886, the story soon became a huge success throughout Europe and America, and achieved unjust notoriety when its hero&#39;s costume of black velvet with lace collar created a fashion for Little Lord Fauntleroy suits which were foisted upon reluctant children. Despite this reaction, however, the warmth and humour of Frances Hodgson Burnett&#39;s story have ensured its survival as a children&#39;s classic and an enduring phenomenon of popular culture. The text is that of the first English edition with significant variations from the first serialization of the story and the first American edition recorded in the notes.</p><h2>Great Vegetarian Dishes</h2><p>In this lavishly illustrated classic cookbook, Kurma presents more than 240 time-tested delectable vegetarian recipes.</p><p></p><h2>River Road Recipes IV: Warm Welcomes&#x2013;Entertaining Menus from Our Homes to Yours</h2><p>The creators of the nation&#39;s number one best-selling community cookbook series welcome you to celebrate all of life&#39;s ordinary and extraordinary occasions.

This major collection of writings draws primarily upon two long out-of-print books--Metaphors on Vision and Brakhage Scrapbook. Brakhage examines filmmaking in relation to social and professional contexts, the nature of influence and collaboration, the aesthetics of personal experience, and the conditions under which various films were made. Brakhage discusses his predecessors and contemporaries, relates film to dance and poetry, and in <i>A Moving Picture Giving and Taking Book</i> provides a manual for the novice filmmaker. Lectures, interviews, essays, and manifestos document Brakhage's personal vision and public persona.</p><p>Stan Brakhage was one of the most influential of independent American filmmakers. From 1952 to 2003 he issued nearly 400 original films, ranging in length from a few seconds to several hours. Among his best known film works are &#39;Dog Star Man,&#39; &#39;The Act of Seeing with one&#39;s own eyes&#39; and &#39;The Dante Quartet.&#39; His many books on film include Metaphors on Vision (Anthology Film Archives, 1963), Film Biographies (Turtle Island, 1977) and Brakhage Scrapbook: Collected Writings, 1964 - 1980 (Documentext, 1982). The recipient of many awards and prizes, including the 1986 Maya Deren Award from the American Film Institute and the 1989 MacDowell Colony Medal, Brakhage was also a professor of film studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder. An artist of prodigous energy and unflagging genius, Stan Brakhage died on March 9, 2003.Two important but long unavailable books by experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage Metaphors on Vision and Brakhage Scrapbook are restored to print in this welcome reissue. Part of the great post-WWII generation of Americans who revolutionized every area of artistic activity, Brakhage was arguably as important to his medium as John Cage or Jackson Pollock were to theirs, and has never received his full due. This is at least partly because his work has been hard to actually see outside of a few places, and there is a lot to see 340 films over 48 years. But anyone who has seen even a minute or two of a film like Dog Star Man with its scratches and painted frames, its stunning juxtaposition of abstraction and materiality immediately recognizes not only Brakhage's singular sensibility, but also its enormous influence on our visual culture. To paraphrase David Bowie talking about the Velvet Underground, not a lot of people saw Brakhage's films, but everyone who did became a filmmaker. Luckily, Brakhage's writings convey much of the volcanic intelligence of his films, as well as eloquently extending their thematic concerns. Brakhage writes in a variety of modes, from the concise filmmaking manual of "A Moving Picture Giving and Taking Book" (written as "a short book on film technique which could be read by poets") to such poetically charged texts as "Angels" and "Notes of Anticipation," in which a film's shot list resembles a text by Gertrude Stein. The book also includes a number of interviews, as well as an annotated list of key films and an extensive bibliography. This book would be important even if Brakhage were not such an engaging writer, but the eclectic range and concision of this collection make it an essential addition to the small library of film classics by filmmakers. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Root and Branch : African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613-1863</h2><p>In this remarkable book, Graham Hodges presents a comprehensive history of African Americans in New York City and its rural environs from the arrival of the first African--a sailor marooned on Manhattan Island in 1613--to the bloody Draft Riots of 1863. Throughout, he explores the intertwined themes of freedom and servitude, city and countryside, and work, religion, and resistance that shaped black life in the region through two and a half centuries. <br><br>Hodges chronicles the lives of the first free black settlers in the Dutch-ruled city, the gradual slide into enslavement after the British takeover, the fierce era of slavery, and the painfully slow process of emancipation. He pays particular attention to the black religious experience in all its complexity and to the vibrant slave culture that was shaped on the streets and in the taverns. Together, Hodges shows, these two potent forces helped fuel the long and arduous pilgrimage to liberty.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Root &amp; Branch</i> sheds tremendous light upon African-American community formation in the urban North. . . .

This fact, however, would astonish all but a select few of his numerous friends and acquaintances. The general consensus was that Lord Vere talked. And talked. And talked. There was no subject under the sun, however remote or abstruse, upon which he did not eagerly venture an opinion or ten. Indeed, there were times when one could not stop him from pontificating on that newly discovered class of chemical substance known as the Pre-Raphaelites, or the curious culinary habits of the Pygmy tribes of central Sweden.<br><br>Lord Vere was also a man who held his secrets close.<br><br>But anyone so deluded as to voice such a pronouncement would find himself surrounded by ladies and gentlemen on the floor, screaming in laughter. For Lord Vere, according to public opinion, could not distinguish a secret from a hedgehog. Not only was he garrulous, he volunteered the most intimate, most inappropriate personal knowledge at the drop of a hat&#x2014;or even without a stitch of haberdashery anywhere in sight.<br><br>He gladly related his difficulties with the courting of young ladies: He was rejected early and rejected often, despite his stature as a peer of the realm. He gave up without hesitation the state of his finances&#x2014;though it had been discovered that he was quite without a notion as to how much funds were at his disposal, current and future, thereby rendering his conjectures largely moot. He even ventured&#x2014;not in mixed company, of course&#x2014;to comment on the size and girth of his masculine endowment: enviable on both counts, the measurements verified by the experiences of the merry widows who looked to him for an occasional tumble in the sheets.<br><br>Lord Vere was, in other words, an idiot. Not a raving one, for his sanity was rarely questioned. And not so moronic that he could not see to his daily needs. Rather, he was an amusing idiot, as ignorant and puffed up as a pillow, silly to the extreme, but sweet, harmless, and very well liked among the Upper Ten Thousand for the diversion he provided&#x2014;and for his inability to remember anything told him that did not affect his meals, his nightly beauty rest, or the pride and joy that resided in his underlinens.<br><br>He could not shoot straight; his bullets never met a grouse except by accident. He rarely failed to turn knobs and levers in the wrong direction. And as his gift for wandering into the wrong place at the wrong time was legendary, hardly anyone batted an eyelash to learn that he was an eyewitness to a crime&#x2014;without having any idea what he&#x2019;d seen, most assuredly.<br><br>Such an extraordinary idiot had he been in the thirteen years since his unfortunate riding accident that no one not privy to his more clandestine activities had ever remarked on his proximity to some of the most sensational criminal cases of the upper crust, shortly before those cases were solved and the culprits brought to justice.<br><br>It was an interesting life, to say the least. Sometimes the tiny handful of other agents of the Crown who knew his true role wondered how he felt about playing the idiot for most of his waking hours. They never found out, for he was a man of few words and held his secrets close.<br><br>Of course, no secret remains a secret forever. . . .the beginning of the end of Lord Vere&#x2019;s secret came, quite literally, in an ambush by a young lady of questionable ancestry and equally questionable methods.<br><br>A young woman who, in a strange twist of fate, would soon become the Marchioness of Vere, his lady wife.<br><br>9 The rats were Vere&#x2019;s idea. His idea of a joke, to be more precise.<br><br>London was emptying at the tail end of the Season. Vere had seen his brother off at the train station earlier in the day; tomorrow he himself was headed for Gloucestershire. There was no time like the beginning of August to appear innocently at a country house to which he might not have been invited&#x2014;and claim that he had: After all, what was one more guest when there were already thirty of them running about?<br><br>But tonight&#x2019;s meeting was about Edmund Doug- las, the reclusive diamond mine owner suspected of extorting from the diamond dealers of London and Antwerp.<br><br>&#x201c;We need a better way to get into his house,&#x201d; said Lord Holbrook, Vere&#x2019;s liaison.<br><br>Holbrook was a few years older than Vere. When Oscar Wilde had been the country&#x2019;s leading literary celebrity, Holbrook had worn his dark hair long and cultivated an air of intellectual ennui. Now that Wilde had gone off to a disgraced exile, Holbrook&#x2019;s languor was accompanied by shorter hair and a more straightforward display of nihilism.<br><br>Vere helped himself to a piece of Savoy cake. The cake was airy and spongy, and just sturdy enough for a spoonful of apricot jam. Holbrook had a way of keeping his hidey-holes&#x2014;a smattering of properties across metropolitan London&#x2014;well supplied, so that whenever his agents had to make use of one, there was always good liquor and the makings of a proper tea.<br><br>Across the gaudy drawing room&#x2014;this particular house behind Fitzroy Square had once housed a succession of kept women&#x2014;Lady Kingsley dabbed a napkin at the corner of her lips. She was a fine-looking brunette about the same age as Holbrook, the daughter of a baronet, and the widow of a knight.<br><br>As covert agents, women had the advantage. Vere and Holbrook must assume personas not their own in order not to be taken seriously&#x2014;an absolute necessity when one went about inquiring after sensitive matters on behalf of the Crown. But a woman, even one as sharp and capable as Lady Kingsley, often managed to be dismissed on nothing more than the fact of her sex. &#x201c;I told you already, Holbrook,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We must make use of Douglas&#x2019;s niece.&#x201d;<br><br>Holbrook, sprawled on a red velvet chaise trimmed in gold fringe, filliped the most recent case report lying on his chest. &#x201c;I thought the niece hadn&#x2019;t left the house in years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Precisely. Imagine you are a girl of twenty-four years, well past the age when a young lady ought to be married, and isolated from all the gaiety and amusement of proper society. What is the one thing that would tempt you the most?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Opium,&#x201d; Holbrook said.<br><br>Vere smiled and said nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Lady Kingsley rolled her eyes. &#x201c;You would wish to meet eligible young men, as many of them as can squeeze under one roof.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you plan to collect a houseful of desirable bachelors, madam?&#x201d; asked Holbrook.<br><br>Lady Kingsley waved her hand in dismissal. &#x201c;That is the easy part, the mustering of manly lures. The problem is that I cannot simply drive up to Highgate Court and present the gentlemen&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been three months since I leased the next-nearest house and I still haven&#x2019;t met her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I?&#x201d; Vere pointed at the report on Holbrook&#x2019;s chest. Holbrook tossed the report his way. Vere caught it and skimmed the pages.<br><br>Edmund Douglas&#x2019;s estate, in which he&#x2019;d maintained residence since 1877, was a manor constructed to his specification. There were hundreds of such new country houses all over the land, built by those with a fortune to spare, thanks to the prosperity of the Age of Steam.<br><br>A fairly common sort of estate, yet one that had proved difficult to penetrate. Plain burglary had not succeeded. An attempt to infiltrate the staff had also failed. And due to Mrs. Douglas&#x2019;s ill health, the family rarely mingled with local society, rendering useless the more socially acceptable routes into the manse.<br><br>&#x201c;Have a domestic disaster on your part,&#x201d; said Vere, to Lady Kingsley. &#x201c;Then you will have an excuse to approach her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. But I&#x2019;m hesitant to damage the roof&#x2014;or the plumbing&#x2014;of a leased house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t your servants come down with something disgusting but not infectious?&#x201d; Holbrook inquired. &#x201c;A case of communal runs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Behave yourself, Holbrook. I am no chemist and I will not poison my own staff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about an infestation of rats?&#x201d; Vere suggested, more to amuse himself than anything else.<br><br>Lady Kingsley shuddered. &#x201c;What do you mean, an infestation of rats?&#x201d;<br><br>Vere shrugged. &#x201c;Put a dozen or two rats to run about the house. Your guests will scream to evacuate. And the rats won&#x2019;t do permanent damage to the house, provided you have a ratcatcher set to work soon enough.&#x201d;<br><br>Holbrook sat up straight. &#x201c;Splendid idea, my dear fellow. I happen to know a man who breeds mice and rats to supply scientific laboratories.&#x201d;<br><br>That did not surprise Vere. Holbrook had at his fingertips a large assortment of bizarre and bizarrely useful contacts.<br><br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s a terrible idea,&#x201d; Lady Kingsley protested.<br><br>&#x201c;Au contraire, I think it is pure genius,&#x201d; declared Holbrook. &#x201c;Douglas travels to London to meet with his solicitor in two weeks, am I correct?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Correct,&#x201d; said Vere.<br><br>&#x201c;That should be enough time.&#x201d; Holbrook reclined back onto his red velvet chaise. &#x201c;Consider it done.&#x201d;<br><br>Lady Kingsley grimaced. &#x201c;I hate rats.&#x201d;<br><br>For Queen and country, madam,&#x201d; said Vere, rising. &#x201c;For Queen and country.&#x201d;<br><br>Holbrook tapped a finger against his lips. &#x201c;Funny you should mention Queen and country, my lord: I have just received word of the blackmailing of a certain royal and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Vere, however, had already shown himself out.</p><h2>Kenojuak Ashevak: Life and Legacy</h2><p><p>Kenojuak Ashevak was a matriarch of modern Inuit art.

The third edition of a highly respected bestseller, <strong>The Art of Systems Architecting</strong> provides in-depth coverage of the least understood part of systems design: moving from a vague concept and limited resources to a satisfactory and feasible system concept and an executable program. The book provides a practical, heuristic approach to the "art" of systems architecting. It provides methods for embracing, and then taming, the growing complexity of modern systems.</p> <p><strong>New in the Third Edition:</strong></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Five major case studies illustrating successful and unsuccessful practices</li> <li>Information on architecture frameworks as standards for architecture descriptions</li> <li>New methods for integrating business strategy and architecture and the role of architecture as the technical embodiment of strategy</li> <li>Integration of process guidance for organizing and managing architecture projects</li> <li>Updates to the rapidly changing fields of software and systems-of-systems architecture</li> <li>Organization of heuristics around a simple and practical process model</li> <p></p></ul> <p>&nbsp;<strong>A Practical Heuristic Approach to the Art of Systems Architecting</strong></p> <p>Extensively rewritten to reflect the latest developments, the text explains how to create a system from scratch, presenting invention/design rules together with clear explanations of how to use them. The author supplies practical guidelines for avoiding common systematic failures while implementing new mandates. He uses a heuristics-based approach that provides an organized attack on very ill-structured engineering problems. Examining architecture as more than a set of diagrams and documents, but as a set of decisions that either drive a system to success or doom it to failure, the book provide methods for integrating business strategy with technical architectural decision making.</p></p><p>Aerospace Corporation, Chantilly, Virginia, USAThe only way to develop this skill is to serve an apprenticeship with a proven practitioner.

James in Computing Millieux</p><h2>The Economics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions</h2><p><p>As Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the late 1970s, Alfred E. Kahn presided over the deregulation of the airlines and his book, published earlier in that decade, presented the first comprehensive integration of the economic theory and institutional practice of economic regulation. In his lengthy new introduction to this edition Kahn surveys and analyzes the deregulation revolution that has not only swept the airlines but has transformed American public utilities and private industries generally over the past seventeen years. While attitudes toward regulation have changed several times in the intervening years and government regulation has waxed and waned, the question of whether to regulate more or to regulate less is a topic of constant debate, one that<i> The Economics of Regulation</i> addresses incisively. It clearly remains the standard work in the field, a starting point and reference tool for anyone working in regulation.Kahn points out that while dramatic changes have come about in the structurally competitive industries - the airlines, trucking, stock exchange brokerage services, railroads, buses, cable television, oil and natural gas - the consensus about the desirability and necessity for regulated monopoly in public utilities has likewise been dissolving, under the burdens of inflation, fuel crises, and the traumatic experience with nuclear plants. Kahn reviews and assesses the changes in both areas: he is particularly frank in his appraisal of the effect of deregulation on the airlines. His conclusion today mirrors that of his original, seminal work - that different industries need different mixes of institutional arrangements that cannot be decided on the basis of ideology.</p></p><p>Alfred E. Kahn (1917-2010) was Robert Julius Thorne Professor of Political Economy at Cornell University and Special Consultant to National Economic Research Associates.</p><h2>ACSM's Behavioral Aspects of Physical Activity and Exercise (Point (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins))</h2><p>This practical text provides the theoretical foundation of behavior change and then offers specific strategies, tools, and methods you can use to motivate and inspire your clients to be active, exercise, and stay healthy.<br>Developed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and written by a team of leading experts in exercise science and motivation, the book provides step-by-step instructions to help fitness/health professionals and students master client motivation techniques. <ul><li>Access practical resources you can use immediately on the job with forms, checklists, charts, worksheets, etc. in each chapter&#x2019;s&nbsp; <b><i>From the Practical Toolbox&nbsp;</i></b> sections.</li><li>Stay on top of the latest research in the field with&nbsp; <b>Evidence</b> sections that support the text&#x2019;s recommendations.</li><li>Master a wide range of client-motivation techniques through&nbsp; <b>Step-by-Step&amp;</b> applications.</li><li>See the text&#x2019;s recommendations in action in real-world settings through engaging <b>Case Scenarios</b></li><li>Improve your retention of important information through&nbsp; <b>Concept Overviews&nbsp;</b> that briefly set the stage for each chapter and <b>Take-Home Messages&nbsp;</b> that highlight key points.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Principles of Biostatistics</h2><p><p>This edition is a reprint of the second edition published in 2000 by Brooks/Cole and then Cengage Learning.</p> <p></p><i> </i><p><i>Principles of Biostatistics </i>is aimed at students in the biological and health sciences who wish to learn modern research methods.

Family hardships forced him to leave school for various occupations, including shipping as a cabin boy to Liverpool in 1839--a voyage that sparked his love for the sea. A shrewd social critic and philosopher in his fiction, he is considered an outstanding writer of the sea and a great stylist who mastered both realistic narrative and a rich, rhythmical prose.''In our own time of terror and torture, <i>Benito Cereno</i> has emerged as the most salient of Melville's works: a tale of desperate men in the grip of a vengeful fury that those whom they hate cannot begin to understand.'' --Andrew Delbanco, author, <i>Melville: His World and Work</i><br><br>''The noblest short story in American literature.'' --Edward J.

It also is continually debated, prompting ongoing legislative changes and market restructuring. One of the best ways to understand healthcare, in all its complexity, is from an economic perspective&#x2014;that is, from the perspective of the financial self-interest of all involved parties.&nbsp;<em> Health Policy Issues: An Economic Perspective</em> takes just such an approach. Renowned author Paul J. Feldstein describes the forces that press for change in healthcare and explains why the US health system has evolved to its current state. This book&#x2019;s 38 concise, issue-oriented chapters cover various aspects of the US health system, including the cost of medical care, health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, physician and nursing shortages, medical school admittance, malpractice reform, prescription drugs, and more. Throughout, the book integrates information about the most significant health policy enacted in many years&#x2014;the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Discussion questions, key points, and further readings round out every chapter. &nbsp; Thoroughly revised and updated with current data and research findings, this seventh edition includes new and expanded content on the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, physician malpractice reform, employee health benefits, generic drug shortages, political versus economic markets, and much more. The updated content includes three new chapters:&#x201c;Should Profits in Healthcare Be Prohibited?&#x201d; discusses the role of profits and the consequences of eliminating profit.&#x201c;Health Associations and the Political Marketplace&#x201d; focuses on the types of legislation demanded by different health associations and explores the economic self-interest of each association&#x2019;s members and policy preferences.&#x201c;The Affordable Care Act: Did It Achieve Its Goals?&#x201d; examines one of the most important objectives of the ACA&#x2014;to reduce the number of uninsured Americans&#x2014;and complements the ACA coverage throughout the book. For 25 years, <em>Health Policy Issues: An Economic Perspective</em> has been highly regarded in the field of health policy. By illuminating the intersection of economics and policy, this topical book helps readers gain a better understanding of the ever-changing and multifaceted healthcare delivery system. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><p><strong>Paul J.

In this deeply sympathetic study, the author compares the principles and the practices of Zen with the traditional concepts, aims, and results of Christian mysticism. His object is, first, ecumenical - to explore the bases of Zen and Christian mysticism, so that Buddhist and Christian can communicate; second, to rethink the basic concepts of Catholic mystical theology in the light of the Zen experience; and last, to encourage more people to contemplative prayer.</p><p>&#39;This is an important book, bridging the much-debated &#39;mysticism gap&#39; between East and West...the book as a whole...has much of great weight to offer not only to the Christian but to the Westerner who wishes to understand Zen better.&#39; - Library JournalWilliam Johnston S.J., an Irish priest who teaches at Sophia University in Tokyo, is the author of many acclaimed books, including, from Fordham University Press, Christian Zen: A Way of Meditation, Being in Love: The Practice of Christian Prayer, and Silent Music: The Science of Meditation.</p><h2>Behavior Theory in Health Promotion Practice and Research</h2><p>Grounded in public health practice, this text offers a comprehensive study of the health behavior theories that are the foundation of all health education and promotion programs.

Professor Rowe attempts to help the reader find a way through the intricate structure both of individual passages and arguments and of the dialogue as a whole, stressing its intelligibility as a unified work of art and giving equal attention to its literary and philosophical aspects. The notes also aim to provide the kind of help with Plato&#39;s Greek which is needed by comparative beginners in the language, but the commentary is intended for any student, classical scholar, or philosopher with an interest in the close reading of Plato.</p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.<b>Plato</b>&nbsp;(c. 427&#x2013;347 B.C.) founded the Academy in Athens, the prototype of all Western universities, and wrote more than twenty philosophical dialogues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Walter Hamilton</b> taught at Cambridge, Eton and Rugby and translated several Platonic texts for Penguin Classics. <br><br><b>Chris Emlyn-Jones</b> teaches in the department of Classical Studies at the Open University and has published on Homer and Plato.</p><h2>Principles of Fraud Examination</h2><p>Accountants have historically had an important role in the detection and deterrence of fraud.

This first of two volumes on Revelation offers systematic and thorough interpretation of the book of Revelation. Revelation brings together the worlds of heaven, earth and hell in a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Its characters and images are both real and symbolic, spiritual and material, and it is frequently difficult to know the difference between them. </p><p>Revelation's cryptic nature has ensured that it would always be a source of controversy. This commentary focuses on the theological content, gleaning the best from both the classical and modern commentary traditions and showing the doctrinal development of Scriptural truths. Scholarship on the book of Revelation has nonetheless not only endured, but even captured the imagination of generations of Bible students, both professionals and laypeople alike. Through its focus on the message of the book through scholarly analysis, this International Theological Commentary reconnects to the ecclesial tradition of biblical commentary as an effort in ressourcement, though not slavish repetition.</p></p><p>A theological verse-by-verse commentary on the book of Revelation.<b>Peter J.

I felt: Macedonio is metaphysics, is literature. Whoever preceded him might shine in history, but they were all rough drafts of Macedonio, imperfect previous versions. To not imitate this canon would have represented incredible negligence."&#x2014;Jorge Luis Borges</p><p><i>The Museum of Eterna's Novel (The First Good Novel)</i> is the very definition of a novel written ahead of its time. Macedonio (known to everyone by his unusual first name) worked on this novel in the 1930s and early '40s, during the heyday of Argentine literary culture, and around the same time that <i>At Swim-Two-Birds</i> was published, a novel that has quite a bit in common with Macedonio's masterpiece.</p><p><br>In many ways, <i>Museum</i> is an "anti-novel." It opens with more than fifty prologues&#x2014;including ones addressed "To My Authorial Persona," "To the Critics," and "To Readers Who Will Perish If They Don't Know What the Novel Is About"&#x2014;that are by turns philosophical, outrageous, ponderous, and cryptic. These pieces cover a range of topics from how the upcoming novel will be received to how to thwart "skip-around readers" (by writing a book that defies linearity!).</p><p>The second half of the book is the novel itself, a novel about a group of characters (some borrowed from other texts) who live on an estancia called "la novella" . . .</p><p>A hilarious and often quite moving book, <i>The Museum of Eterna's Novel</i> redefined the limits of the genre, and has had a lasting impact on Latin American literature.

He's given up his career as a journalist to write an authorized biography of his father-in-law, communications magnate and former CIA agent Big Bill Mulholland. He works in a big office in Mulholland Tower, rent-free, and goes home (most nights) to his wealthy and well-preserved wife, Wild Bill's daughter. He misses his old life sometimes, but all in all things have turned out well.</p><p>But when his shifty young researcher--a man he calls "The Lemur"--turns up some unflattering information about the family, Glass's whole easy existence is threatened. Then the young man is murdered, and it's up to Glass to find out what The Lemur knew, and who killed him, before any secrets come out--and before any other bodies appear.Shifting from 1950s Dublin to contemporary New York, the masterful crime writer Benjamin Black returns in this standalone thriller--a story of family secrets so deep, and so dangerous, that anyone might kill to keep them hidden.</p></p><p><p><b>Benjamin Black</b> is the pen name of John Banville, who was born in Wexford, Ireland, in 1945. His novels have won numerous awards, mostly recently the Man Booker Prize in 2005 for <i>The Sea</i>. Under the name Benjamin Black he is also the author of <i>Christine</i><i> Falls</i> and <i>The Silver Swan</i>. He lives in Dublin.</p><p>Chapter One<br>GLASSHOUSES<br>The researcher was a very tall, very thin young man with a head too small for his frame and an Adam&#x2019;s apple the size of a golf ball. He wore rimless spectacles the lenses of which were almost invisible, the shine of the glass giving an extra luster to his large, round, slightly bulging black eyes. A spur of blond hair sprouted from his chin, and his brow, high and domed, was pitted with acne scars. His hands were slender and pearly- pale, with long, tapering fingers&#x2014;a girl&#x2019;s hands, or at least the hands a girl should have. Even though he was sitting down, the crotch of his baggy jeans sagged halfway to his knees. His none too clean T-shirt bore the legend Life Sucks and Then You Die. He looked about seventeen but must be, John Glass guessed, in his late twenties, at least. With that long neck and little head and those big, shiny eyes, he bore a strong resemblance to one of the more exotic rodents, though for the moment Glass could not think which one.His name was Dylan Riley. Of course, Glass thought, he would be a Dylan.&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Riley said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re married to Big Bill&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;He was lounging in a black- leather swivel chair in Glass&#x2019;s borrowed office on the north- facing side of Mulholland Tower. Behind him, through a wall of plate glass, gray Manhattan sulked steamily under a drifting pall of April rain.&#x201c;Does that seem funny to you?&#x201d; Glass inquired. He had an instinctive dislike of people who wore T-shirts with smart things written on them.Dylan Riley snickered. &#x201c;Not funny, no. Surprising. I wouldn&#x2019;t have picked you as one of Big Bill&#x2019;s people.&#x201d;Glass decided to let that go. He had begun to breathe heavily through his nostrils, hisss-hiss, hisss- hiss, always a warning sign.&#x201c;Mister Mulholland,&#x201d; Glass said heavily, &#x201c;is eager that I have all the facts, and that I have them the right way round.&#x201d;Riley smiled his goofy smile and swiveled the chair first to one side and then the other, nodding happily. &#x201c;All the facts,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;sure.&#x201d; He seemed to be enjoying himself.&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Glass said with stony emphasis, &#x201c;all the facts. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m hiring you.&#x201d;In one corner of the office there was a big square metal desk, and Glass went now and sat down carefully behind it. He felt less panicstricken sitting down. The office was on the thirty- ninth floor. It was absurd to be expected to conduct business&#x2014;to do anything&#x2014;at such a height. On his first day there he had edged up to the plate-glass wall and peered down to see, a couple of floors below, fluffy white clouds that looked like soft icebergs sailing sedately across a sub-merged city. Now he put his hands .at on the desk before him as if it were a raft he was trying to hold steady. He very much needed a cigarette.Dylan Riley had turned the chair around to face the desk. Glass was sure the young man could sense how dizzy and sick he felt, perched up here in this crystal-and-steel eyrie.&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Glass said, moving his right hand in a wide arc across the desktop as if to sweep the subject aside; the gesture made him think of footage of Richard Nixon, sweating on the evening news all those years ago, insisting he was not a crook. The studios were so harshly lit in those days of paranoia and recrimination they had made pretty well everyone look like a villain in an old Eastmancolor movie. &#x201c;I should tell you,&#x201d; Glass said, &#x201c;that Mr. Mulholland will give you no assistance. And I don&#x2019;t want you to approach him. Don&#x2019;t call, don&#x2019;t write. Understand?&#x201d;Riley smirked and bit his lower lip, which made him look all the more like&#x2014;what was it? A squirrel? No. Close, but no. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told him,&#x201d; Riley said, &#x201c;have you. About me, I mean.&#x201d;Glass ignored that. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not asking you to be a muckraker,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t expect Mr. Mulholland to have guilty secrets. He was an undercover agent, but he&#x2019;s not a crook, in case you think I think he is.&#x201d;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Riley said, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s your father- in- law.&#x201d;Glass was breathing heavily again. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d like you to forget about,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when you come to do your researches.&#x201d; He sat back on his chair and studied the young man. &#x201c;How will you go about it&#x2014;researching, I mean?&#x201d;Riley laced his long pale fingers over his concave stomach and this time rocked himself gently backward and forward in the swivel chair, making the ball- and-socket mechanism underneath the seat squeal tinily, eek, eek.&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Riley said with a smirk, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s say I go way beyond Wikipedia.&#x201d;&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll use... computers, and so on?&#x201d; Glass did not possess even a cell phone.&#x201c;Oh, yes, computers,&#x201d; Riley said, making his big eyes bigger still, mocking the older man, &#x201c;all sorts of wizard gadgets, don&#x2019;t you know.&#x201d;Glass wondered if that was supposed to be a British accent. Did Riley think he was English? Well, let him.He imagined lighting up: the match flaring, the lovely tang of sulphur, and then the harsh smoke searing his throat.&#x201c;I want to ask you something,&#x201d; Riley said, thrusting his pinhead forward on its tall stalk of neck. &#x201c;Why did you agree to it?&#x201d;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;&#x201c;To write Big Bill&#x2019;s biography.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s any of your business,&#x201d; Glass said sharply. He looked out at the misty rain. He had moved permanently from Dublin to New York six months previously, he had an apartment on Central Park West and a house on Long Island&#x2014;or at least his wife had&#x2014;yet he had still not got used to what he thought of as the New York Jeer.The fellow on the street corner selling you a hot dog would say, &#x201c;Thanks, bud,&#x201d; and manage to make it sound merrily derisive. How did they keep it going, this endless, amused, argumentative squaring up to each other and everyone else?&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;what you know about Mr. Mulholland.&#x201d;&#x201c;For free?&#x201d; Riley grinned again, then leaned back and looked at the ceiling, fingering the tuft of hair on his chin. &#x201c;William &#x2018;Big Bill&#x2019; Mulholland. South Boston Irish, second generation. Father ran off when wee Willie was a kid, mother took in laundry, scrubbed floors.In school William got straight As, impressed the priests, was an altar boy, the usual. Tough, though&#x2014;any pedophile cleric coming near Bill Mulholland would likely have lost his balls. Put himself through Boston College. Engineering. At college was recruited into the CIA, became a working operative in the late forties. Electronic surveillance was his specialty. Korea, Latin America, Europe, Vietnam. Then he had a run- in with James Jesus Angleton over Angleton&#x2019;s obsessive distrust of the French&#x2014;Big Bill was posted to the Company&#x2019;s Paris bureau at the time. In those days one did not incur the displeasure&#x201d;&#x2014;again that hopeless attempt at a British accent&#x2014;&#x201c;of James Jesus without getting cut off at the knees, which is what would have happened to Bill Mulholland if he hadn&#x2019;t got out before Angleton could give him the shove, or worse. That was the late sixties.&#x201d;He pushed himself up out of the chair, unwinding himself like a fakir&#x2019;s rope, and shambled to the glass wall and stood looking out, his hands thrust into the back pockets of his jeans. He went on: &#x201c;After he left the Company, Big Bill got into the then-blossoming communications business, where he put his training as a spook to good use when he set up Mulholland Cable and right away began to make shitloads of money. It wasn&#x2019;t until twenty years later that he had to bring in his protï¿½gï¿½ Charlie Varriker to save the firm from going bust.&#x201d; He paused, and without turning said: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know about Big Bill&#x2019;s matrimonial adventures, I guess? In 1949 he married the world&#x2019;s most famous redhead, Vanessa Lane, Hollywood actress, if that&#x2019;s the word, and in 1949 the marriage was duly dissolved&#x201d;&#x2014;now he grinned over his shoulder at Glass&#x2014;&#x201c;ain&#x2019;t love just screwy?&#x201d;He went back to contemplating the misted city and was silent for a moment, thinking. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s such a CIA clichï¿½ I wonder if the CIA didn&#x2019;t invent him. Look at his next marriage, in &#x2019;58, to Claire Thorpington Eliot, of the Boston Eliots&#x2014;that was some step up the social ladder for Billy the Kid from Brewster Street. He had, as you will know, one child only, a daughter, Louise, by the second Mrs. Mulholland. Miz Claire, as this grand lady was called, died in a hunting accident&#x2014;balking horse, broken neck&#x2014;in April 1961, on the eve, as bloody- minded Fate would have it, of the invasion of the Playa Girï¿½n, otherwise known as the Bay of Pigs, a venture in which Big Bill was sunk up to his neck. The grieving widower returned from the shores of Florida to find the Eliots already moving his things, including his two- year- old daughter, out of the grand old family mansion in Back Bay.&#x201d;He turned and walked back and slumped down in the chair and again turned his eyes to the ceiling. &#x201c;Next thing,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;Big Bill was married a third time, to Nancy Harrison, writer, journalist, and Martha Gellhorn&#x2013;look- alike, and living with her on a fine estate in County Somewhere on the west coast of Ireland, not an Oscar statuette&#x2019;s throw from the home of his old friend and drinking buddy John Huston.Grand days, by all accounts, but bound to end, like all such. Blond Nancy couldn&#x2019;t take the endless rain and the low- browed natives and packed up her Remington and hightailed it for sunnier climes&#x2014;Ibiza, Clifford Irving, Orson Welles, all that.&#x201d; He stopped, and lowered his glossy gaze from the ceiling and fixed on Glass. &#x201c;You want more, I got more.

Jack Fletcher is shipwrecked off the coast of Japan - his beloved father and the crew lie slaughtered by ninja pirates. Rescued by the legendary sword master Masamoto Takeshi, Jack&#39;s only hope is to become a samurai warrior. And so his training begins. But life at the samurai school is a constant fight for survival. Even with his friend Akiko by his side, Jack is singled out by bullies and treated as an outcast. With courage in his heart and his sword held high, can Jack prove himself and face his deadliest rival yet?</p><p>Chris Bradford has trained in karate, kickboxing and samurai swordsmanship. He earned his black belt in Zen Kyo Shin Taijutsu, the secret fighting art of the ninja. Before writing the Young Samurai series, he was a professional musician and songwriter and has performed for HRH Queen Elizabeth II. You can learn more about Chris Bradford and his books at www.youngsamurai.com.Starred Review. Debut author Bradford comes out swinging in this fast-paced adventure set in medieval Japan, the first in the projected Young Samurai trilogy. Twelve-year-old Jack Fletcher has gained a reputation aboard a British merchant vessel as an agile rigging monkey. But after Japanese ninja murder the entire crew, including his father, Jack is left alone and injured to cope with strange customs and indecipherable language. When he shows his fortitude and cleverness, however, a powerful samurai adopts him and sends him to learn the ways of Japan's warrior class. Jack's story alone makes for a page-turner, but coupling it with intriguing bits of Japanese history and culture, Bradford produces an adventure novel to rank among the genre's best. The intricate and authentic descriptions of martial arts contests will hold readers spellbound. Just as potent for many readers, though, are the outright hatred and prejudice Jack faces as a <i>gaijin</i>, or foreigner, while he attempts to master an elaborate code of honor. This book earns the literary equivalent of a black belt. Ages 10&#x2013;up. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Winner of a Pulitzer Prize, he wrote more than forty-five plays, including <i>True West</i>, <i>Fool for Love</i>, and <i>Buried Child</i>. Shepard also appeared in more than fifty films, beginning with Terrence Malick&#x2019;s <i>Days of Heaven</i>, and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in <i>The Right Stuff</i>. Despite the publicity his work and life attracted, however, Shepard remained a strongly private man who said many times that he would never write a memoir. But he did write intensively about his inner life and creative work to his former father-in-law and housemate, Johnny Dark, who was Shepard&#x2019;s closest friend, surrogate brother (they were nearly the same age), and even artistic muse.</p> <p><i>Two Prospectors</i> gathers nearly forty years of correspondence and transcribed conversations between Shepard and Dark. In these gripping, sometimes gut-wrenching letters, the men open themselves to each other with amazing honesty. Shepard&#x2019;s letters give us the deepest look we will ever get into his personal philosophy and creative process, while in Dark&#x2019;s letters we discover insights into Shepard&#x2019;s character that only an intimate friend could provide. The writers also reflect on the books and authors that stimulate their thinking, their relationships with women (including Shepard&#x2019;s anguished decision to leave his wife and son&#x2014;Dark&#x2019;s stepdaughter and grandson&#x2014;for actress Jessica Lange), personal struggles, and accumulating years. Illustrated with Dark&#x2019;s candid, revealing photographs of Shepard and their mutual family across many years, as well as facsimiles of numerous letters, <i>Two Prospectors</i> is a compelling portrait of a complex friendship that anchored both lives for decades, a friendship also poignantly captured in Treva Wurmfeld&#x2019;s film, <i>Shepard &amp; Dark</i>.</p></p><p>Chad Hammett teaches at Texas State University&#x2013;San Marcos, from which he received an M.F.A. in fiction."The volume has the feel of an earlier age. . . . The correspondence . . . is rich with allusions to Kerouac and Beckett. . . . A bright pathway directly into the hearts and minds of two compelling men." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2013-07-01)<br><br>"It's fascinating to read about folks who inspire creative genius otherwise known as muses...Two Prospectors offers the reader nearly four decades of letters, taped conversations, and photos shared between Shepard and Dark, resulting in a fascinating study of friendship and artistic pursuit."

But she found that no matter how carefully you remodel your life, murder can take up residence anywhere.<br><br>It&#x2019;s Eastport&#x2019;s most notorious landmark: the old Harlequin House. Named for the disgraced physician Chester Harlequin, it was used as a hideout for gunshot gangsters and their molls during Prohibition&#x2019;s heyday. Now fixer-upper enthusiast Jake Tiptree and Harlequin&#x2019;s only living descendant, Ellie White, are refurbishing the mansard-roofed mansion to host the local Historical Society&#x2019;s upcoming gala. But when stripping down old wallpaper reveals a secret door to a room containing not one but two corpses, Jake and Ellie once again find home repair leading to homicide.<br><br>One of the bodies is a skeleton dressed in 1920s flapper chic. But the other is that of <br>real-estate mogul Hector Gosling, and in his pocket is a paper bearing the single word &#x201c;Guilty.&#x201d; The less-than-scrupulous tycoon has been poisoned, and when it&#x2019;s learned that the offending substance is the poison that Ellie&#x2019;s husband George has been using to kill red ants, he is immediately taken into custody. Then it develops that George had recently accused Gosling of a scheme to scam George&#x2019;s vulnerable old aunt out of her life savings&#x2014;and George out of his inheritance. <br><br>With George held for murder, Jake and a pregnant Ellie swing into action. In between Ellie&#x2019;s Lamaze sessions, baby showers, and CPR classes taught by Jake&#x2019;s ex-husband <br>Victor, the two amateur sleuths must sift their way through a trail of seemingly contradictory clues. Then another corpse surfaces and suddenly Jake and Ellie realize they must find this killer fast. A clever culprit is not only building an airtight case against Ellie&#x2019;s husband. He&#x2014;or she&#x2014;is planning to nail everyone who stands in the way.</p><p>Sarah Graves lives with her husband in Eastport, Maine, where her mystery novels are set. She is currently working on her twelfth Home Repair Is Homicide novel.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>The body was all withered sinews and leathery skin, seated on a low wooden chair in the tiny room whose door my friend Ellie White and I had just forced open. Slumped over a table, one arm outstretched, the body wore a sequined chemise whose silver hem-fringe crossed its mummified thigh.<br><br>Masses of bangles circled the knobby wrists and rings hung loosely on the long bony fingers. From beneath black bobbed hair the hollow eye sockets peeked coyly at us, the mouth a toothy rictus of mischief.<br><br>Or malice. A candle burnt down to a puddled stub stood in an ornate holder by the body&#x2019;s arm. A tiaralike headpiece with a glass jewel in its bezel had fallen to the floor.<br><br>Ellie and I stood frozen for a moment, neither of us able to speak for the horridness of the surprise. Then:<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; breathed Ellie, sinking heavily into the window seat of the dilapidated parlor we&#x2019;d been working on. It was Saturday morning and around us the aging timbers of Eastport&#x2019;s most decrepit old mansion, Harlequin House, creaked uneasily.<br><br>Only the wind, I told myself. Outside it was blowing a gale. But the fact brought little comfort since after a century or so without maintenance, the old mansion&#x2019;s skeleton was probably less sturdy than the body we were staring at. Being sealed in the room had apparently preserved it like some denizen of King Tut&#x2019;s tomb.<br><br>&#x201c;A woman,&#x201d; Ellie added, her voice still faint with shock.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I responded, sniffing the air curiously. Thinking . . . something. I just didn&#x2019;t know exactly what, yet.<br><br>The parlor was lit by a couple of lamps we&#x2019;d brought from home, the power in the house having been turned on only the day before. This morning was meant to be a work party but it seemed the storm had discouraged all but the two of us. Around us lay damp swathes of stripped wallpaper and the scrapers and putty knives we&#x2019;d been using to pull down chunks of cracked plaster.<br><br>It was behind one of those cracks we&#x2019;d first found the faint outlines of a hidden aperture, and of course a secret door had been irresistible. Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to learn what lay behind it, where it might lead?<br><br>But now I reentered the chamber cautiously. Its air smelled of the dust to which its occupant had partially returned, and of something else, the faint whiff I&#x2019;d caught earlier: not dusty.<br><br>Not in the slightest. The lamplight barely reached the back of the little room. As my eyes adjusted to the gloom there, I made out the shape in the corner.<br><br>And identified it, wishing I hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get out of here,&#x201d; I said, exiting hurriedly.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; said Ellie, misunderstanding me. &#x201c;I just felt strange for a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Her speedy recovery was little more than I expected. Ellie wasn&#x2019;t usually much daunted by dead bodies, antique or otherwise. Her shaky reaction to this one I put down to the fact that at the moment she was as pregnant as a person could be without actually wheeling into the delivery room.<br><br>&#x201c;Help me . . . oof! . . . up.&#x201d; Gripping my hand, she struggled to her feet. &#x201c;I swear this isn&#x2019;t a kid, it&#x2019;s a Volkswagen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only a little longer,&#x201d; I comforted her distractedly, still staring into the hidden room.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;d better be,&#x201d; she retorted. &#x201c;If this baby doesn&#x2019;t come soon I&#x2019;m going to start charging it rent.&#x201d;<br><br>There were two bodies in there.<br><br>&#x201c;Lots,&#x201d; she emphasized, &#x201c;of rent.&#x201d;<br><br>One old body. And a new one. &#x201c;Ellie, have you ever heard any stories about another door into this room?&#x201d;<br><br>She could have, if one existed. An ancestor on Ellie&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s side, Chester Harlequin, had owned the house in its heyday.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She peered puzzledly at me. With her red hair softly framing a heart-shaped face, green eyes above freckles the color of gold dust, and a long slim body blooming out at the middle like some enchanted flower, Ellie resembled a storybook princess and was as tough as Maine granite.<br><br>But she was in trouble now and she didn&#x2019;t even know it.<br><br>Yet.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d never even heard of this one,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;I have seen photographs of this parlor, though, back when&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Her gesture took in the ramshackle interior wall where the door had been concealed, its trim removed and panels smoothed over by a coat of plaster topped with the same fusty vines-and-grape-leaves pattern as the rest of the ornate old chamber.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;the wallpaper was new,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Last time this room was redone was sometime back in the twenties.&#x201d;<br><br>Although when it was hung, that paper had probably looked ultramodern. In its time Harlequin House had been a showplace, with parquet floors, marble mantels, and chandeliers so grand and numerous that the house for a while was dubbed &#x201c;the crystal palace.&#x201d;<br><br>Why someone had also walled a body up in it was a question I supposed might never be answered&#x2014;not after more than eighty years. Which I guessed was truly how long the woman had been dead; the state of the plaster, the wallpaper, and the body&#x2019;s own costume all testified to it pretty convincingly.<br><br>Yet there were no additional obvious entrances to the room, and the inner walls were all of unplastered boards. Any break in them, however well repaired, would have been clearly visible. In short it appeared that the room had been sealed since the first body was entombed. So how&#x2019;d the second one gotten in there?<br><br>&#x201c;I know her,&#x201d; Ellie said suddenly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen old pictures of her wearing the dress and the tiara. It&#x2019;s Eva Thane, the woman my Uncle Chester was . . . So that&#x2019;s what happened to her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ellie, wait.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d gotten her wind back and was about to reenter the room, her shock giving way to the curiosity that was among her most prominent character traits.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she demanded impatiently. &#x201c;I want a closer look at . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Then she understood, or thought she did. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re right of course, a flashlight will help.&#x201d; She drew one from her smock pocket.<br><br>The windowless room was enclosed on all sides with a center hall at its rear, kitchen to its left, the parlor plus a vestibule and coatroom to its front and right. The house was so huge that a square of missing space wouldn&#x2019;t be missed, especially tucked as it was to one side of an enormous black marble fireplace.<br><br>Ellie aimed the flash past me and sucked in a surprised breath. &#x201c;Him,&#x201d; she exhaled, recognizing the dead face instantly just as I had, despite the unpleasantness of its disfigurement.<br><br>But having been unnerved once, Ellie was not about to show faintheartedness a second time. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she continued briskly, &#x201c;this certainly isn&#x2019;t going the way we planned.&#x201d;<br><br>Which was an understatement. Begun just today, the Harlequin House fix-up was supposed to be a labor of love. Assisted by a small army of local volunteers, we were to ready the old dwelling for a gala put on by the Eastport Historical Society, and in doing so perhaps up the chances that someone&#x2014;anyone!&#x2014;might actually take the place off the Society&#x2019;s impoverished hands afterwards.<br><br>And the first corpse, I thought, might even have helped. A long-dead flapper from the Roaring 20s could have been just the hook this old money-pit needed to snag the attention of a buyer with cash vastly exceeding common sense.<br><br>But the newer body was of more than historical interest.<br><br>Way more. &#x201c;We have a problem, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; Ellie said.<br><br>She was starting to catch on. Eva Thane&#x2019;s antique corpse dropped off her mental radar as a new and more unpleasant light dawned.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Fraid so,&#x201d; I agreed unhappily. The dead man was Hector Gosling, Eastport&#x2019;s most irascible real-estate mogul as well as the current president of the historical society. His face was smudged with grime, as were his clothes, a condition that would have been unthinkable while Hector was alive. But even filthy and hideously exaggerated as it was now, that furious teeth-baring grimace was an all-too-familiar expression.<br><br>Combined with his position, however&#x2014;feet and head on the floor, midsection arched tautly, agonizingly up like a drawn bow&#x2014;Hector&#x2019;s look didn&#x2019;t say fury or anything like it.<br><br>What it said, unfortunately, was strychnine.<br><br> I am the type who goes more for structural guts than shelter- magazine glory, so if Harlequin House had been mine I&#x2019;d have started renovation with the underpinnings, the wooden sills and the foundation. At the same time I&#x2019;d be tearing off the roof, all the trim, and the chimneys and siding. All the windows would come out, too, as would the wiring, plumbing, and heating. Inside, I&#x2019;d pull down every last bit of the cracked, ancient plaster, and fix all the lath.<br><br>Only when the house sat four-square on its footings with its mechanicals updated, its windows made weathertight, insulation layered onto it, and its new trim and clapboards coated with oil-based primer and paint would I even give a thought to wallpaper.<br><br>Whereupon I would reject it. These old houses have been smothering in garish floral patterns and gloomy scenic designs for long enough, in my opinion. They need paint in a nice light color scheme, off-white woodwork, and freshly sanded floors.<br><br>But as I say, the house didn&#x2019;t belong to me. So for a little while Ellie and I went on puttering and pondering, deciding what we would say when we summoned the authorities.<br><br>And what might need doing afterwards.<br><br>&#x201c;I mean, George and I have a problem. But mostly George does,&#x201d; Ellie said. &#x201c;Or he might have.&#x201d;</p><h2>Background to Danger</h2><p>Kenton&#39;s career as a journalist depended on his facility with languages, his knowledge of European politics, and his quick judgment.

Mr. Walt Disney's movie <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> had come to Meriden.<br> My mother had read the true story of Snow White to my brother and me. I couldn't wait to see it in the movies. I thought Mr. Walt Disney was the best artist I had ever seen (I already knew that I wanted to be an artist, too). I loved his cartoons?especially "Silly Symphonies," Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and the Three Little Pigs. But now Mr. Walt Disney had done the first ever full-length animated movie?one and a half hours long.<br> I had been to a lot of movies?more than Buddy, even though he was eight. Because I didn't go to school yet, my mother took me with her to the movies in the afternoons. We both loved movies. My favorite movie stars were Shirley Temple, the little girl with blonde curls who could sing and dance better than anyone, and Miss Mae West. (I called her Miss because she was grown up while Shirley Temple was about my age. We always called grown-ups Miss, Mr., or Mrs.) Miss Mae West was blonde, too, and she could sing. She didn't dance, but she was all shiny and glittery and all she had to do was walk and talk and everyone in the movie theater laughed and laughed.<br> Mom, Buddy, and I went to see <i>Snow White </i>on a Saturday. We got in line early at the Capitol Theatre so that we could get good seats. My mom bought the tickets, and as we went into the lobby, music was playing. She bought each of us a box of Mason's Black Crows?little chewy licorice candies (they didn't have popcorn at the movies yet).<br> We found our seats. The lights went down. First we saw a newsreel (it was all the real things that were going on in the world). After that was the coming attraction about the next movie that would be shown at the Capitol. And finally, with the sound of trumpets, and glittery stars filling the screen, the words I had been waiting for: "Feature Presentation."<br> A big book appeared on the screen with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on the front cover. The book opened. My mother read the words to me quietly: "Once upon a time..."<br> Music played, and there, in beautiful color, was Snow White, with white doves flying all around her. She was down on her knees, scrubbing the stairs in the Evil Queen's castle. Snow White asked the doves if they wanted to know a secret. They cooed yes. She told them they were standing by a wishing well. Then she sang a song about wishing for her prince to come.<br> WOW! I was really seeing <i>Snow White</i>, and it was the best movie I had ever seen. <br> Then the prince came on the screen and sang to Snow White. The Evil Queen, looking fierce and mean, watched. My brother sank down in his seat.<br> The Evil Queen went to her Magic Mirror and said the words I knew so well: "Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" The mirror said it was Snow White, and the Evil Queen looked angrier than ever. Buddy sank down even farther.<br> But he really freaked out when the Evil Queen ordered the huntsman to take Snow White into the woods to be killed, and the woods looked just like Hemlock Grove. Tree limbs grabbed at Snow White, and yellow eyes stared down at her.<br> It was scary, and I loved it. But lots of kids didn't, and suddenly I heard crying and screaming all around me, even from Buddy. "I want to go home!" he yelled. "Come on," my mother said, standing up. "Let's go."<br> "I'm not going," I said. I had waited a long time for Mr. Walt Disney's movie. My mom, who is probably the smartest woman in the world, understood. "All right, Tomie, sit right here and don't move. I'll be in the lobby with your brother." That was fine with me.<br> Lots of mothers left with their kids. I thought that was a good thing to do if the kids were afraid of the trees. They probably would wet their pants when the Evil Queen made the poisoned apple for Snow White and drank the magic potion to turn herself into the Evil Witch (even I was a little scared when that happened).<br> Then things about the story started to bother me. Why was the Evil Queen making the poisoned apple now? The true story was different. In that story, before the Evil Queen gave Snow White the apple, she went to the dwarfs' cottage and pulled the laces of Snow White's vest so tight that Snow White couldn't breathe and she fainted. The dwarfs came home just in time to loosen the laces and save her.<br> Next, the Queen went a second time to visit Snow White with a poison comb, which she stuck in Snow White's hair. Snow White fainted once more, but the dwarfs got back in time to take the comb out and save her again.<br> The <i>third </i>time was the poisoned apple.<br> Maybe Mr. Walt Disney hadn't read the true story, because he used only the apple. I stood up and shouted at the movie screen, "Where are the laces? Where is the comb?"<br> A lady behind me said, "Hush, little boy! Sit down." I did, and the movie was like the book again until the dwarfs put Snow White into the crystal coffin.<br> But I knew that Mr. Walt Disney hadn't read the true story carefully enough because he got it all mixed up with "Sleeping Beauty" and had the Prince kiss Snow White, and she woke up. In the true story the Prince carries the coffin to his palace, and on the way the piece of poisoned apple falls out of Snow White's mouth and she wakes up. But this time I didn't yell at the movie screen, in case the lady behind me got mad at me again.<br> But when "The End" appeared on the screen, boy, was I mad! I couldn't help it. I stood up and hollered, "The story's not over yet. Where's the wedding?

As Bette Davis aged she was looking for an assistant, but she found something more than that in Kathryn: a loyal and loving buddy, a co-conspirator in her jokes and schemes, and a competent assistant whom she trained never to miss a detail. But Miss D had strict rules for Kathryn about everything from how to eat a salad to how to wear her hair...even the spelling of Kathryn's name was changed (adding the "y") per Miss D's request. Throughout their time together, the two grew incredibly close, and Kathryn had a front-row seat to the larger-than-life Davis's career renaissance in her later years, as well as to the humiliating public betrayal that nearly killed Miss D. <br><br> The frame of this story is a four-day road trip Kathryn and Davis took from Biarritz to Paris, during which they disentangled their ferocious dependency. <i>Miss D and Me</i> is a window into the world of the unique and formidable Bette Davis, told by the person who perhaps knew her best of all.</p><p><b>Kathryn Sermak</b> is the co-founder of the Bette Davis Foundation and co-executor of the Bette Davis Estate. In addition to Bette Davis, Kathryn has been personal assistant to HH Princess Shams Pahlavi; French actress, Isabelle Adjani; the statesman and journalist, Pierre Salinger; astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin, Motown Founder, Berry Gordy Jr.; famed American designer, Patrick Kelly; and the co-creator of <i>Where's Waldo</i>, Michael Gornall. Kathryn was also among the first to receive the Personal Assistant Career Award in 2003. Visit her at missdandme.com."America loved Bette Davis for the great star she was. I had the privilege of being her friend. She lived by good old-fashioned Yankee standards; she expected much and gave much; she was forthright, honest, and had a great sense of humor. Kathryn Sermak's book is a beautifully insightful look at the real Bette Davis."&#x2015;<b><i>George Hamilton<br></i></b><br><br>"We should all hope that we have a Kathryn Sermak in our lives whose love and devotion overcame any odds she might have encountered in her remarkable journey with Miss D. This book is homage to both ladies and a wonderful read."&#x2015;<b><i>Stefanie Powers</i></b><br><br>"None of us knew or loved Bette Davis during her later years more than Kathryn Sermak. This is a wonderful book about one of the greatest women I ever knew--and one of the greatest actresses who gave us all so very, very much.

Kathryn Sermak tells it like it was: with candor and style--certainly the Bette Davis I was fortunate enough to know!"&#x2015;<b><i>Greg Gorman, celebrity photographer</i></b><br><br>"<i>Miss D &amp; Me</i> is a fascinating look at the life of this indomitable star and her young assistant, Kathryn, during the last ten years of Miss Davis's life. It is their inspirational journey, which begins with Miss D as mentor<b>-</b>instructing Kathryn in every detail of work as well as the social graces<b>-</b>and ultimately leads to a devoted friendship. I highly recommend it."&#x2015;<b><i>Ann-Margret<br></i></b><br><br>"Kathryn Sermak has given us a well-written and vivid account of her long association with one of the most remarkable women of the past century: Bette Davis.

Inspired by a fateful road trip the two women embarked upon through France in 1985, the book - based on Sermak's extensive archive of datebooks, photographs and audio cassettes - offers an intimate glimpse into the last 10 years of the screen icon's life, until her passing in 1989 with Sermak by her side."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Deeply personal, strangely enthralling."&#x2015;<b><i><i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"When Kathryn Sermak was hired as Bette Davis's personal assistant in 1979, she was a 22-year-old ingenue who had no idea who the great movie star was. For the next ten years she would help the woman she regarded as her mentor and, subsequently, friend, through her twilight years that brought illness and a devastating betrayal by her daughter, B.D. Hyman, in a brutal memoir about her mother. Davis's heartbreak is also keenly felt by Sermak in her deeply personal Miss D And Me.

She was involved in land speculation in Florida and in international smuggling, and was caught up in three different slave systems. She was also a part of far larger histories. Marsh&#39;s lifetime saw new connections being forged across nations, continents, and oceans by war, empire, trade, navies, slavery, and print, and these developments shaped and distorted her own progress and the lives of those close to her. Colley brilliantly weaves together the personal and the epic in this compelling story of a woman in world history.</p><p><b>Linda Colley</b> has taught at Cambridge, Yale, and the London School of Economics and is currently Shelby M. C. Davis Professor of History at Princeton University. Her book, <i>Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707-1837, </i>was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and won the Wolfson Prize. Professor Colley writes for British and American periodicals and newspapers, including <i>The Guardian, The Times, The New York Times, The Times Literary Supplement</i>, and <i>The London Review of Books.</i><b>Chapter One: Out of the Caribbean</b><br><br>The beginning prefigured much of the rest. She came to life against the odds, in a place of rampant death, and in the midst of forces that were already transforming large stretches of the globe.<br><br>The man who became her father, Milbourne Marsh, first set foot on Jamaica on 20 July 1732, which was when his ship, the <i>Kingston</i>, anchored off Port Royal.[1] The <i>Kingston </i>was one of a squadron of Royal Navy vessels ordered to the Caribbean that spring with instructions to deter smuggling in the region and attacks on British merchant shipping by Spanish armed coastguards, and to suppress any slave rebellions within Jamaica itself. Since wresting it from the Spanish in 1655, retaining this island had become increasingly important to the English, and subsequently to the British state, initially because of its location and size. Ninety miles south of Cuba, Jamaica was ideally situated for legal and illicit trade with Spain&#x2019;s settlements in the Americas, and for staging attacks on them and on Spanish treasure ships, bearing gold and silver from New World mines back to Seville. At some 140 miles from east to west, Jamaica was also ten times larger than the rest of Britain&#x2019;s Caribbean islands combined. Tropical, fertile and well-watered, it offered&#x2013;for all its steep, mountainous interior and steamy forests &#x2014; sufficient arable land, or so at first it seemed, to accommodate large numbers of incoming white smallholders. When Milbourne Marsh arrived, individuals of very modest means, indentured servants, shopkeepers, skilled labourers, cooks, peddlers, retired or runaway sailors, itinerants, pen-keepers (cow-farmers), garrison troops and the like still made up between a half and a third of Jamaica&#x2019;s white population. But the island&#x2019;s smallholders were in retreat before the rise of much larger landed estates and a single crop. Jamaica&#x2019;s sugar industry did not reach the height of its profitability until the last third of the eighteenth century. Even so, by the 1730s, with over four hundred sugar mills, the island had comfortably overtaken Barbados as the biggest sugar-producer in Britain&#x2019;s Empire.[2]<br><br>Although much of the technology employed on sugar plantations remained unchanged for centuries, these were still brutally innovative places. The unending work of planting, harvesting and cutting the sugar cane, milling it, boiling and striking the sugar syrup, transporting the finished products, rum, molasses, and the various sugars to the dockside, and loading them aboard ship, fostered task specialization, the synchronization of very large quantities of labour, and the imposition of shift systems and a ruthless time discipline.[3] Establishing the necessary mills, boiling houses and other fixed plant required large-scale capital investment; and plantation owners were acutely dependent on long-distance oceanic trade and communications to sell their products&#x2013;and to recruit and import their workforces. As the historian David Eltis writes:<br><br>&#x201c;The slave trade was possibly the most international activity of the pre-industrial era. It required the assembling of goods from at least two continents [Asia and Europe] . . . the transporting of those goods to a third [Africa], and their exchange for forced labour that would be carried to yet another continent [the Americas].&#x201d;<br><br>Between a third and a half of the more than 1.2 million men, women and children purchased by British traders and carried in British ships from West Africa between 1700 and 1760 were probably landed in Jamaica. When Milbourne Marsh arrived here, the island contained almost eighty thousand black slaves, most of them recent arrivals from the Gold Coast, the Bight of Biafra and the Bight of Benin.[4]<br><br>There were other ways, too, in which Jamaica functioned as a laboratory for new ways of living and new types of people. Port Royal, Milbourne Marsh&#x2019;s landfall on the island&#x2019;s south-eastern coast, was an extreme case in point. The English had found its deep offshore waters, and its position at the end of a nine-mile spit separating Kingston harbour from the Caribbean, ideally suited for the loading and unloading of merchantmen from Europe and North America. Port Royal was also useful, they soon discovered, for piracy and for conducting contraband trade with, and raids against, Cuba, Hispaniola and mainland Spanish America. In 1688, 213 ships are known to have docked at Port Royal, almost as many as the total number calling that year at all of New England&#x2019;s ports. With its almost seven thousand slaves, shopkeepers, merchants, sailors, book-keepers, lawyers, sea captains, craftsmen, wives, children, smugglers and &#x2018;crue of vile strumpets and common prostratures&#x2019;, the town was also more populous at this stage than its main competitor in British America, Boston, Massachusetts. And since its two thousand houses, many of them brick and some of them four prosperous storeys high, clustered together on barely fifty acres of gravel and sand, Port Royal was probably the most crowded and expensive English-speaking urban settlement outside London.[5]<br><br>Then came the earthquake. It happened at 11.43 a.m. on 7 June 1692. In ten minutes, two-thirds of Port Royal and two thousand of its citizens disappeared beneath the sea. A further three thousand died of injuries and disease in the days after: <br><br>&#x201c;The sky, which was clear and serene, grew obscured and red throughout the whole extent of Jamaica. A rumbling noise was heard under ground, spreading from the mountains to the plain; the rocks were split; hills came close together; infectious lakes appeared on the spots where whole mountains had been swallowed up; immense forests were removed several miles from the place where they stood; the edifices disappeared . . . This terrible phenomenon should have taught the Europeans not to trust to the possessions of a world that trembles under their feet, and seems to slip out of their rapacious hands.&#x201d;<br><br>In so describing its destruction, Abbï¿½ Raynal and his collaborators were adding an anti-colonialist twist to a tradition of moralizing disapproval of Port Royal that was in existence well before the earthquake.[6] Yet this lost town, a kind of maritime Pompeii, had been a dynamic and creative as well as a corrupt, exploitative place, and after the earthquake there were repeated attempts to rebuild it. They were aborted by a major fire in 1704 and a succession of hurricanes; and when Milbourne Marsh arrived, little remained of Port Royal except &#x2018;three handsome streets, several cross lanes, and a fine church&#x2019;, the nearby garrison, Fort Charles, and a small naval dockyard where ships from Britain&#x2019;s Jamaica fleet were repaired and victualled. The town&#x2019;s main commercial and slaving businesses had moved to nearby Kingston, which was more sheltered from the elements, and there were barely five hundred white inhabitants remaining in Port Royal, most of the men amongst them employed by the Royal Navy or as soldiers in Fort Charles.[7]<br><br>Port Royal&#x2019;s most material legacy was arguably Jamaica&#x2019;s developing sugar monoculture, since both the town&#x2019;s gentile merchants and their Jewish counterparts had been important sources of credit for planters wanting to purchase land and slaves.[8] As this suggests, Jamaica was at once brutally divided by racial difference and violence, and in some respects also a cosmopolitan, even tolerant environment. The cosmopolitanism expressed itself in flamboyant consumerism. A taste for imported Chinese ceramics, for instance, seems to have been more prevalent in households in Port Royal before 1692, and in other Jamaican settlements, than in either British or mainland colonial American homes. At another level, British Jamaica resembled &#x2018;a curious terrestrial space-station&#x2019; full of &#x2018;fragments of various races, torn from the worlds of their ancestors&#x2019;.[9] Most white incomers, like Milbourne Marsh himself, were young, single, male Protestants from southern England; but there were also Scots, Protestant and Catholic Irish, Portuguese-speaking Sephardic Jews from Brazil and Surinam, Huguenots, Dutchmen, occasional French and Spanish spies, smugglers and traders from nearby St Domingue and Cuba, and mainland American colonists, principally from Boston, New York and Philadelphia. There were about 8300 of these miscellaneous whites by the early 1730s, and the island&#x2019;s ethnically and culturally diverse black population outnumbered them by more than ten to one.[10]<br>NOTES<br>[1] See the Lieutenant&#x2019;s log: <i>NMM</i>, ADM/L/K 40A.<br>[2] &#x2018;State of Jamaica&#x2019;, c.1735: <i>NA</i>, PC 1/58/3.

Other strangers appear in pursuit of the girl. Menace is in the air.<br><br>Originally published in 1933, Hammett's <b>Woman in the Dark</b> shows the author at the peak of his narrative powers. With an introduction by Robert B. Parker, the author of the celebrated Spenser novels.</p><p>Dashiell Samuel Hammett was born in St. Mary&#x2019;s County. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Hammett left school at the age of fourteen and held several kinds of jobs thereafter&#x2014;messenger boy, newsboy, clerk, operator, and stevedore, finally becoming an operative for Pinkerton&#x2019;s Detective Agency. Sleuthing suited young Hammett, but World War I intervened, interrupting his work and injuring his health. When Sergeant Hammett was discharged from the last of several hospitals, he resumed detective work. He soon turned to writing, and in the late 1920s Hammett became the unquestioned master of detective-story fiction in America. In <b>The Maltese Falcon</b> (1930) he first introduced his famous private eye, Sam Spade. <b>The Thin Man</b> (1932) offered another immortal sleuth, Nick Charles. <b>Red Harvest</b> (1929), <b>The Dain Curse</b> (1929), and <b>The Glass Key</b> (1931) are among his most successful novels. During World War II, Hammett again served as sergeant in the Army, this time for more than two years, most of which he spent in the Aleutians. Hammett&#x2019;s later life was marked in part by ill health, alcoholism, a period of imprisonment related to his alleged membership in the Communist Party, and by his long-time companion, the author Lillian Hellman, with whom he had a very volatile relationship. His attempt at autobiographical fiction survives in the story &#x201c;Tulip,&#x201d; which is contained in the posthumous collection <b>The Big Knockover</b> (1966, edited by Lillian Hellman). Another volume of his stories, <b>The Continental Op</b> (1974, edited by Stephen Marcus), introduced the final Hammett character: the &#x201c;Op,&#x201d; a nameless detective (or &#x201c;operative&#x201d;) who displays little of his personality, making him a classic tough guy in the hard-boiled mold&#x2014;a bit like Hammett himself.Her right ankle turned under her and she fell. The wind blowing downhill from the south, whipping the trees beside the road, made a whisper of her exclamation and snatched her scarf away into the darkness. She sat up slowly, palms on the gravel pushing her up, and twisted her body sidewise to release the leg bent beneath her. <br><br>Her right slipper lay in the road close to her feet. When she put it on she found its heel was missing. She peered around, then began to hunt for the heel, hunting on hands and knees uphill into the wind, wincing a little when her right knee touched the road. Presently she gave it up and tried to break the heel off her left slipper, but could not. She replaced the slipper and rose with her back to the wind, leaning back against the wind's violence and the road's steep sloping. Her gown clung to her back, flew fluttering out before her. Hair lashed her cheeks. Walking high on the ball of her right foot to make up for the missing heel, she hobbled on down the hill. <br><br>At the bottom of the hill there was a wooden bridge, and, a hundred yards beyond, a sign that could not be read in the darkness marked a fork in the road. She halted there, not looking at the sign but around her, shivering now, though the wind had less force than it had had on the hill. Foliage to her left moved to show and hide yellow light. She took the left-hand fork. <br><br>In a little while she came to a gap in the bushes beside the road and sufficient light to show a path running off the road through the gap. The light came from the thinly curtained window of a house at the other end of the path. <br><br>She went up the path to the door and knocked. When there was no answer she knocked again. <br><br>A hoarse, unemotional masculine voice said: "Come in." <br><br>She put her hand on the latch; hesitated. No sound came from within the house. Outside, the wind was noisy everywhere. She knocked once more, gently. <br><br>The voice said, exactly as before: "Come in." <br><br>She opened the door. The wind blew it in sharply, her hold on the latch dragging her with it so that she had to cling to the door with both hands to keep from falling. The wind went past her into the room, to balloon curtains and scatter the sheets of a newspaper that had been on a table. She forced the door shut and, still leaning against it, said: "I am sorry." She took pains with her words to make them clear notwithstanding her accent. <br><br>The man cleaning a pipe at the hearth said: "It's all right." His copperish eyes were as impersonal as his hoarse voice. "I'll be through in a minute." He did not rise from his chair. The edge of the knife in his hand rasped inside the brier bowl of his pipe. <br><br>She left the door and came forward, limping, examining him with perplexed eyes under brows drawn a little together. She was a tall woman and carried herself proudly, for all she was lame and the wind had tousled her hair and the gravel of the road had cut and dirtied her hands and bare arms and the red crepe of her gown. <br><br>She said, still taking pains with her words: "I must go to the railroad. I have hurt my ankle on the road. Eh?" <br><br>He looked up from his work then. His sallow, heavily featured face, under coarse hair nearly the color of his eyes, was not definitely hostile or friendly. He looked at the woman's face, at her torn skirt. He did not turn his head to call: "Hey, Evelyn." <br><br>A girl--slim maturing body in tan sport clothes, slender sunburned face with dark bright eyes and dark short hair--came into the room through a doorway behind him. <br><br>The man did not look around at her. He nodded at the woman in red and said: "This--" <br><br>The woman interrupted him: "My name is Luise Fischer." <br><br> The man said: "She's got a bum leg." <br><br>Evelyn's dark prying eyes shifted their focus from the woman to the man--she could not see his face--and to the woman again. She smiled, speaking hurriedly: "I'm just leaving. I can drop you at Mile Valley on my way home." <br><br>The woman seemed about to smile. Under her curious gaze Evelyn suddenly blushed, and her face became defiant while it reddened. The girl was pretty. Facing her, the woman had become beautiful; her eyes were long, heavily lashed, set well apart under a smooth broad brow, her mouth was not small but sensitively carved and mobile, and in the light from the open fire the surfaces of her face were as clearly defined as sculptured planes. <br><br>The man blew through his pipe, forcing out a small cloud of black powder. "No use hurrying," he said. "There's no train till six." He looked up at the clock on the mantelpiece. It said ten-thirty-three. "Why don't you her with her leg?" <br><br> The woman said: "No, it is not necessary. I--" She put her weight on her injured leg and flinched, steadying herself with a hand on the back of a chair. <br><br>The girl hurried to her, stammering contritely: "I--I didn't think. Forgive me." She put an arm around the woman and helped her into the chair. <br><br>The man stood up to put his pipe on the mantelpiece, beside the clock. He was of medium height, but his sturdiness made him look shorter. His neck, rising from the V of a gray sweater, was short, powerfully muscled. Below the sweater he wore loose gray trousers and heavy brown shoes. He clicked his knife shut and put it in his pocket before turning to look at Luise Fischer. <br><br>Evelyn was on her knees in front of the woman, pulling off her right stocking, making sympathetic clucking noises, chattering nervously: "You've cut your knee too. Tch-tch-tch! And look how your ankle's swelling. You shouldn't have tried to walk all that distance in these slippers." Her body hid the woman's bare leg from the man. "Now, sit still and I'll fix it up in a minute." She pulled the torn red skirt down over the bare leg. <br><br>The woman's smile was polite. She said carefully: "You are very kind." <br><br>The girl ran out of the room. <br><br>The man had a paper package of cigarettes in his hand. He shook it until three cigarettes protruded half an inch and held them out to her. "Smoke?" <br><br>"Thank you." She took a cigarette, put it between her lips, and looked at his hand when he held a match to it. His hand was thick-boned, muscular, but not a laborer's. She looked through her lashes at his face while he was lighting his cigarette. He was younger than he had seemed at first glance--perhaps no older than thirty-two or -three--and his features, in the flare of his match, seemed less stolid than disciplined. <br><br>"Bang it up much?" His tone was merely conversational. <br><br>"I hope I have not." She drew up her skirt to look first at her ankle, then at her knee. The ankle was perceptibly though not greatly swollen; the knee was cut once deeply, twice less seriously. She touched the edges of the cuts gently with a forefinger. "I do not like pain," she said very earnestly. <br><br>Evelyn came in with a basin of steaming water, cloths, a roll of bandage, salve. Her dark eyes widened at the man and woman, but were hidden by lowered lids by the time their faces had turned toward her. "I'll fix it now. I'll have it all fixed in a minute." She knelt in front of the woman again, nervous hand sloshing water on the floor, body between Luise Fischer's leg and the man. <br><br>He went to the door and looked out, holding the door half a foot open against the wind. <br><br>The woman asked the girl bathing her ankle: "There is not a train before it is morning?" She pursed her lips thoughtfully. <br><br>"No." <br><br>The man shut the door and said: "It'll be raining in an hour." He put more wood on the fire, then stood--legs apart, hands in pockets, cigarette dangling from one side of his mouth--watching Evelyn attend to the woman's leg. His face was placid. <br><br>The girl dried the ankle and began to wind a bandage around it, working with increasing speed, breathing more rapidly now. Once more the woman seemed about to smile at the girl, but instead she said, "You are very kind." <br><br>The girl murmured: "It's nothing." <br><br>Three sharp knocks sounded on the door. <br><br>Luise Fischer started, dropped her cigarette, looked swiftly around the room with frightened eyes. The girl did not raise her head from her work. The man, with nothing in his face or manner to show he had noticed the woman's fright, turned his face toward the door and called in his hoarse, matter-of-fact voice: "All right. Come in."</p><h2>Curious George Takes a Job</h2><p>Curious George runs away from the zoo and after many adventures ends up a movie star.</p><p><p><b>Hans </b>and <b>Margret Rey </b>created many books during their lives together, including&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, one of the most treasured classics of all time, as well as other favorites like&nbsp;<i>Spotty&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Pretzel.</i>&nbsp;But it was their rambunctious little monkey who became an instantly recognizable icon. After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.<br> &nbsp;</p><br><br>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.

He's secured the position of lighthouse keeper mostly for the isolation--the chance to hide from his past is appealing. He's not expecting the current keeper to be a feisty and beautiful woman who's angry with him for taking her job and for his inability to properly run the light. When his failings endanger others, he and Caroline realize he's in no shape to run the lighthouse, but he's unwilling to let anyone close enough to help.

The mansion has nearly one hundred rooms, and her uncle keeps himself locked up. And at night, she hears the sound of crying down one of the long corridors.<br> <br>The gardens surrounding the large property are Mary&#x2019;s only escape. Then, Mary discovers a secret garden, surrounded by walls and locked with a missing key. With the help of two unexpected companions, Mary discovers a way in&#x2014;and becomes determined to bring the garden back to life.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite Manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin, Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Wizard of Oz: The Original 1900 Edition in Full Color</h2><p><p>Before "The Wizard of Oz" was a movie, it was a children's book.&nbsp; It was written in 1899 and published in 1900.&nbsp; This edition is a carefully re-constructed facsimile that is as close to the original as modern book printing technology will allow.&nbsp; If you are looking for the earliest release of this children's classic, be prepared to fork over thousands of dollars for the original edition, published as <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, in 1900 by the George M. Hill Company .&nbsp; If you want a faithful reconstruction that will make your guests look twice and delight your kids, this is the edition you want.</p> <p>Please note:&nbsp; as this is a facsimile edition, it will contain all of the flaws and imperfections of the original.&nbsp; This is by definition.&nbsp; Since the original images were engravings, which was a common necessity for book printers of the 1800s, the image quality itself will be different than what many modern readers expect.&nbsp; But, while it contains the flaws of the original, it also has its magic, as well.</p> <p>As such, it will be a great way to read the story the way its authors originally intended it before Victor Fleming and Hollywood got a hold of it.&nbsp; It will also be a handsome addition to your bookshelf!</p></p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>Women of the Beat Generation: The Writers, Artists and Muses at the Heart of a Revolution</h2><p>Winner of an American Book Award, this collection is an unprecedented exploration of the lives, writings, and astonishing stories of the longoverlooked women of the Beat Generation from the famous Carolyn Cassady &amp; Jan Kerouac to the relatively undiscovered Mary Fabilli &amp; Helen Adam.

In fact, I would have probably shrugged my shoulders and said, &#x201c;Yes, of course I am.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to open a restaurant. I grew up in Minnesota, but my parents emigrated from Argentina just before I was born, and my sisters and I were raised around a table with lively Spanish conversation and with food that was strange by midwestern standards (at the time, we may have been the only Argentine Jews in Minneapolis). Growing up, my favorite pastimes were playing restaurant, dreaming about food, and reading cookbooks, so opening a restaurant someday would not have seemed impossible.&nbsp;<br><br>As fate would have it, I grew up and opened a small restaurant in one of the biggest cities in the world. But the part that would have surprised me as a child&#x2014;and, in a way, still surprises me today&#x2014;is that my restaurant, Txikito, is Basque. I can imagine my ten-year-old self scratching her head and asking, &#x201c;What does <i>Basque </i>mean?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve been running Txikito since 2007, and I still don&#x2019;t have a definitive response to that question. But it&#x2019;s one that I strive to answer, for myself and for the people we feed, every day.&nbsp;<br><br>Cooking is a perfect vocation for people who like to find and make connections. To me, food is a way to tell a story, and even though I don&#x2019;t want to tell the same stories over and over again, I do want a common thread to connect the stories that I do tell. My husband, Eder, who is also my co-chef at Txikito, puts it a little differently: he says I&#x2019;d open a new restaurant every week if I could. So it&#x2019;s not surprising that he is both frustrated by and supportive of this story, which is the story of how I met Basque food and found a home in a cuisine that has held my attention in ways that no other can.&nbsp;<br><br>Part of what made both Basque food and Eder, who is Basque, so attractive is that Basque cooking meant that I could return to living my life in Spanish. My affinity goes deeper than that, however: I love all of the cuisines of Spain, but Basque food has a very specific mystique. It doesn&#x2019;t hide behind strong&nbsp;Mediterranean flavors. Instead, it celebrates single ingredients and tastes and constantly reminds the cook that &#x201c;simple&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean &#x201c;easy.&#x201d; Basque food makes you a better cook. It teaches you to respect ingredients, embracing and amplifying their natural flavors. I&#x2019;d argue that many professional cooks would get better if they practiced Basque cooking, as it forces you to unlearn bad habits and pay attention to details. The Basque cook responds to <i>la materia prima</i>, or main ingredients, a tiny bit differently each time. Intuitively understanding how to make these minor adjustments is a sign of the cook&#x2019;s experience and skill.&nbsp;<br><b>Mussels with white beans&nbsp;</b><br> mejillones y pochas en salsa verde&nbsp;<br>serves 4&nbsp;<br><br>This light stew of white beans and bouchot mussels is a Txikito signature. When I first encountered <i>pochas</i>, a creamy white bean typical of Navarra, I envisioned a salad or a blond stew. It turns out they are often served smothered with quail in a rich dark sauce. I think the lightness of this preparation is more respectful of the bean and reflects the general approach to cooking at the restaurant. Here, the beans take the place of the potatoes commonly found in dishes made with <i>salsa verde</i>, which, along with <i>salsa pil pil</i>, <i>salsa tinta</i>, and <i>salsa bizkaï¿½na</i>, is one of the most important sauces of Basque cuisine. When making the sauce, be sure to cook off the alcohol before adding the beans, or the dish will be too acidic.

Each page is imbued with urgency, with sincerity, with heartache, with heart.... Her words, alongside the words of other survivors of atrocity and their descendants across the globe, can help us build a more humane world." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b> <br><br> As firsthand survivors of many of the twentieth century's most monumental events&#x2015;the Holocaust, Hiroshima, the Killing Fields&#x2015;begin to pass away, <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> addresses urgent questions: How do we carry those stories forward? How do we collectively ensure that the horrors of the past are not forgotten? <br><br> Elizabeth Rosner organizes her book around three trips with her father to Buchenwald concentration camp&#x2015;in 1983, in 1995, and in 2015&#x2015;each journey an experience in which personal history confronts both commemoration and memorialization. She explores the echoes of similar legacies among descendants of African American slaves, descendants of Cambodian survivors of the Killing Fields, descendants of survivors of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the effects of 9/11 on the general population. Examining current brain research, Rosner depicts the efforts to understand the intergenerational inheritance of trauma, as well as the intricacies of remembrance in the aftermath of atrocity. <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> becomes a lens for numerous constructs of memory&#x2015;from museums and commemorative sites to national reconciliation projects to small-group cross-cultural encounters. <br><br> Beyond preserving the firsthand testimonies of participants and witnesses, individuals and societies must continually take responsibility for learning the painful lessons of the past in order to offer hope for the future. <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> offers a clear-eyed sense of the enormity of our twenty-first-century human inheritance&#x2015;not only among direct descendants of the Holocaust but also in the shape of our collective responsibility to learn from tragedy, and to keep the ever-changing conversations alive between the past and the present.</p><p><b>ELIZABETH ROSNER</b> is the author of three novels and a poetry collection. <i>The Speed of Light</i> was translated into nine languages and won several awards in the US and in Europe, including being shortlisted for the prestigious Prix Femina. <i>Blue Nude</i> was named among the best books of 2006 by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>. <i>Electric City</i> was named among the best books of 2014 by NPR.

Her impressive, highly readable <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> takes on important issues of atrocity, trauma, and memory, rendering them all with such great clarity and intimacy that the reader will not soon forget them, or this powerful book." &#x2015;Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>The Sympathizer</i> <br><br> "This is a personal exploration for Rosner, but also an exploration of the commonalities found in the children of survivors." &#x2015;<i>Read it Forward</i> <br><br> "<i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> is an exercise in mapmaking, in identifying convergent paths in apparently disparate legacies left by the world&#x2019;s humanitarian disasters . . .

In this important and vital contribution to the conversation about legacy and responsibility, Rosner distills the magnitude of such burdens and defines the scope of memorialization with an elegance and eloquence that reverberates with both depth and nuance." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review) <br><br> "A thoughtful, probing meditation on the fragility of memory and the indelible inheritance of pain." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br><br> "Novelist Rosner (<i>Electric City</i>) shines an unblinking light on the most horrific of 20th-century crimes and asks: What is the intergenerational legacy of trauma? . . . She considers art, anniversaries, memorials, and psychotherapy, but the most powerful technique she finds for dealing with trauma is simply telling the story behind it . . . Themes of memory, language, and the bodily imprint of trauma are powerful, as are Rosner&#x2019;s accounts of revisiting Buchenwald with her father . . . Rosner's conclusions&#x2015;that powerful suffering must be communicated before healing can occur and that the most profound of human atrocities must be acknowledged so that their like does not happen again&#x2015;open the door to understanding and, optimistically, show a path to peace." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br> "This is the book that clinicians and patients alike have been waiting for.

A mixture of history, personal narrative, and research, the book expertly documents how atrocities are passed down through generations and how we may find ways to contain this pernicious inheritance. <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> is a vital, living document that proves the end of war is far from the end of the battle." &#x2015;Andrew Carroll, editor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>War Letters</i> and <i>Behind the Lines</i> <br><br> "Elizabeth Rosner explores how trauma infiltrates minds and bodies and language. In lyrical, luminous prose, she takes on the obligation to remember lives lost. Genocide, war, nuclear bombs, lynching&#x2015;Rosner does not turn away from unceasing violence and its aftermath. Urgent and necessary, this book offers brave witness to the world we have made and must repair." &#x2015;Sarah Sentilles, author of <i>Draw Your Weapons</i> <br><br> &#x201c;A staggering work of intellectual vigor and raw emotion, <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i> mines the darkest recesses of our collective past, excavating both the hate and hope of human history. Rosner's intimate handling of intergenerational trauma, as well as the need to acknowledge and transcend it, reminds us of the power and mercy of stories. In our current age of hyper-immediacy, with increasingly short news cycles and even shorter memories, Rosner's work reminds us of our sacred duty to carry these stories forward like a lantern in the dark.&#x201d; &#x2015;Aline Ohanesian, author of <i>Orhan's Inheritance</i> <br><br> "Using the Holocaust as a focal point, <em>Survivor Cafï¿½</em> renders a profound and unflinching portrait of trauma and the memory of trauma, the consequences of inhumanity, atrocities that do not end with one generation but are inherited as nightmare, memory, and affliction, passed on to the next generation and the next and the next. With vivid stories and brilliant insights, this book must be required reading for those who want to understand not just our collective history but the present moment." &#x2015;Susan Griffin, award-winning author of <em>A Chorus of Stones</em> <br><br> "In this haunting and poetic book, Elizabeth Rosner summons her readers to a deep and abiding commemoration of genocide. The daughter of Holocaust survivors, Rosner describes scientific evidence that deep trauma persists not only emotionally but also physically through generations. This is an inspired, illuminated book&#x2015;the fruit of hard experience and deep study. I salute Elizabeth Rosner&#x2019;s <i>Survivor Cafï¿½</i>, a work of wisdom and, ultimately, hope." &#x2015;Elizabeth Farnsworth, author of <i>A Train Through Time</i> <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Electric City</i></b> <br><br> "Rosner beautifully bridges past and present in the dynamism of her historical depictions, capturing the dangers and excitement of invention, the complex play between generations of America's immigrant populations and its native peoples, the wonder of young love, and the insatiable spark of curiosity that is a calling card of scientific inquiry, and a hallmark of the human heart." &#x2015;<i>Elle Magazine</i> <br><br> "Rosner's lyrical new novel chronicles the rise and fall of this company town, following several generations of immigrants and the Native American people who watched them come...Through layers of time 'sticky like amber,' Rosner etches images of family, community, and the electric power of love." &#x2015;Jane Ciabattari, <i>BBC</i> <br><br> "...remarkable, lyrical... It's a wondrous thing to watch the deepening and unfurling of a writer's talent over one book and another and another. <i>Electric City</i> is Elizabeth Rosner at her best yet, a book that leaves the reader hungering for her next." &#x2015;<i>Chicago Tribune</i> <br><br> "Rich and poignant...The provenance of each character is thematically and dramatically significant...and the novel beautifully explores the ways we attach ourselves to a place, the ways we might escape it, and how these things, like the Hudson River, often flow both ways." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br><br> "Rosner skillfully captures the city's conflicts between science and nature, history and progress. From immigrant experience to coming-of-age story, <i>Electric City</i> is a luminous tale." &#x2015;<i>San Jose Mercury News</i> <br><br> "...there is also a great affection in this novel, for a place at once as old as lightning and as young as the latest invention. All the characters in this book&#x2015;and, I suppose, this reviewer&#x2015;are just molecules passing through the Electric City." &#x2015;<i>Historical Novel Society</i> <br><br> "Rosner's richly imagined historical novel conveys an abiding sense of time and place. A deeply evocative paean to the wonders of science, the perils of technology, and the sacrifices of people in thrall to their power." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "With deft descriptions, Rosner sketches the bustling city, on land long cherished by aboriginal culture, which grew and flourished as whites invaded and industrialized...offers a gentle meditation on love and loss." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i> <br><br> "This beautiful book joins the compression, vivid intensity, and imaginative connectivity of poetry to the deep character work of the novel. Rosner handles with effortless assurance both the small, intimate stories and the great impersonal worlds of science, nature, and history that combine to make us who we are." &#x2015;Karen Joy Fowler, <i>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</i>, Winner of the 2014 PEN/Faulkner Award <br><br> "A heady mix of world-changing history (Thomas Edison and Charles Steinmetz) coupled against a bewitching love triangle ignites Rosner's gorgeously written exploration of the way inventions transform cities, hearts, and lives, sometimes with a terrible cost, and the way light nudges inroads in the darkness. Electrifyingly original." &#x2015;Caroline Leavitt, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Is This Tomorrow</i> and <i>Pictures of You</i> <br><br> "Reminiscent of <i>In the Skin of a Lion</i> and set in a 1960s New York manufacturing town once founded by Thomas Edison, <i>Electric City</i> is a love story made incandescent by Rosner's prose. The triangle she creates between Sophie Levine and her two admirers is as tangled, tragic, and beautiful as the history of their fundamentally American city." &#x2015;Maria Hummel, author of <i>Motherland</i> <br><br> "At the heart of this gripping novel is the brilliant mathematician Charles Proteus Steinmetz, whose ability to capture lightning in a bottle electrifies a city and animates the lives of friends and strangers. Rosner achieves something just as powerful and thrilling in this marvelous book." &#x2015;Ann Packer, author of <i>The Dive from Clausen&#x2019;s Pier</i> <br><br> "<i>Electric City</i> is the gripping narrative of an ever-changing America seen through the prism of one town caught between the past and the future, and the tangled tragic love triangle set within it. Compelling, beautiful, important, and timeless, <i>Electric City</i> is as much a thoughtful look at our changing past as it is a metaphor for the present. Elizabeth Rosner is a bright literary light." &#x2015;Jennifer Gilmore, author of <i>The Mothers </i> <br><br> "At once a subtly nuanced love story, a celebration of American invention, and a critique of the juggernaut of 'progress' in the twentieth century, <i>Electric City</i> is a compelling, deeply moving novel about the heyday and decline of Schenectady (the titular "Electric City") as an industrial power. The novel moves between the twenties and sixties, deftly interweaving the historical and fictional in a way that illuminates the tension between western ideas of progress and Native American rhythms and sensibilities. But the real incandescence in this story comes from Rosner's luminous, eloquent prose. Simply a beautiful novel." &#x2015;Marjorie Darraugh, Pegasus Books <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Blue Nude</i></b> <br><br> "An elegiac story of an emotionally and creatively starved artist and his muse..The present diverges to the past, and Rosner develops her protagonists as though they are pieces of art, slowly becoming unveiled. Although their backgrounds are divergent, their interior lives are similar. Rosner&#x2019;s multilayered composition is rendered in beautiful, spare prose and will resonate long after the last page." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br> "We watch, spellbound, as the story seems to levitate midair, as the characters seamlessly unfold a plot that is no less than fascinating. Using the rhythms of poetry, Elizabeth Rosner has created a lyrical tour de force." &#x2015;Linda Gray Sexton, <i>Half in Love: Surviving the Legacy of Suicide</i> <br><br> "Rosner has a painter's eye and a poet's ear. Blue Nude is a luminous book about painful histories&#x2015;both private and global&#x2015;and how they stay with us even as they travel through to become something else&#x2015;quite possibly art. A book both heady and tangible, both unflinching and generous, but always beautiful to read." &#x2015;Karen Joy Fowler, <i>The Jane Austen Book Club</i> <br><br> "Through German artist, Danzig, and Israeli muse, Merav, Elizabeth Rosner builds a bridge from loss to reconciliation, from anger to understanding. <i>Blue Nude</i> is a lyrical exploration of how we -- as individuals and as a society&#x2015;move past our separate histories and toward a shared redemption. This is truly a lovely book." &#x2015;Meg Waite Clayton, <i>The Wednesday Sisters</i> <br><br> "Blue Nude is a novel which spans time and continents, from post war Germany to California to Israeli kibbutzim, a novel which explores the big questions of history, fate, art, how we choose to live the lives we&#x2019;re given&#x2013;and yet it&#x2019;s also wonderfully intimate as well in its exploration of the hearts of its individual characters.

And as the war raged on, the enemy seemed to be lurking everywhere: prowling in submarines off the coast of Cape Cod, arriving on passenger ships in the harbor, or disguised as the radical lecturing workers about the injustice of a sixty-hour workweek.<br><i>War Fever </i>explores this delirious moment in American history through the stories of three men: Karl Muck, the German conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, accused of being an enemy spy; Charles Whittlesey, a Harvard law graduate who became an unlikely hero in Europe; and the most famous baseball player of all time, Babe Ruth, poised to revolutionize the game he loved. Together, they offer a gripping narrative of America at war and American culture in upheaval.<br></p><p><b>Randy Roberts</b> is the 150th anniversary distinguished professor of history at Purdue University.

She&#x2019;s a hero of the form: the sudden fiction, the flash fiction, whatever it&#x2019;s being called these days. The stories are short. They defy logic. They thumb their nose at conventional sense, or even unconventional sense. But if sense is in short supply in these texts, that leaves more room for splendor and sorrow. These stories upend expectations and prize enigma and the uncanny above all else. The Williams epiphany should be patented, or bottled&#x2014;on the other hand, it should also be regulated and maybe rationed, because it&#x2019;s severe. It&#x2019;s a rare feeling her stories trigger, but it&#x2019;s a keen and deep and welcome one, the sort of feeling that wakes us up to complication and beauty and dissonance and fragility.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane Williams is the founder and editor of the distinguished literary annual, <i>NOON</i>, the archive of which, as well as Williams' personal literary archive, was acquired in 2014 by the Lilly Library.&nbsp;She is the author of eight previous volumes of short fiction.

Her face looked something more than bitter, with hair which it turned out was a hat, which came down over her ears, which was made of fake fur, which she never removed from her head. She had glasses on. Everything she wore helped me decide to let her in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wore flat black patent-leather shoes with pointed toes, with black stockings, wrinkled at the ankles, with silver triangles set in on top of the toes of the shoes to decorate them, and she had on a long black coat, and she was shorter than I am.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skin was a bleak sort of skin, and there was no beauty left in her&#x2014;maybe in her body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt that this lady is fast, because she was at the place where I keep my red rotary-dial phone before I was, after I said, &#x201c;The phone is in here.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;I know the number.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting on the arm of my sofa, she dialed while her knees were knocking into and tipping back onto two legs my too-small table, which my phone sits on, and my oversized brass lamp, which sits on the table too, with the huge shade, might have crashed. The lamp was clanging, ready to go. She got it back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, <i>&#x201c;Merla!&#x201d;</i> into the phone receiver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew it&#x2014;she must have known it&#x2014;Merla knew it too, that Merla was only a matter of one hundred to two hundred yards from my house, because this woman I had let in, she had told me right off the house number she was looking for. She was telling Merla that it was impossible to get to her, that there was no way on earth, that she had kept on running into this east-west street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A nice picture,&#x201d; she said to me. She had gotten herself up. She was looking at all of those men dressed for one of the dark-age centuries, marching through foliage, trekking around a hunched-up woman at a well, with their weird insignias on their chests, that nobody I know can figure out, with their faces&#x2014;version after version of the same face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, &#x201c;I have a&#x201d;&#x2014;something something&#x2014;&#x201c;reproduction&#x2014;&#x201d; I cannot remember the dates or the royal reign to which she referred, when she was toying with this miniature chair that I have, grabbing it by its arm, and swiveling it on the clubbed foot of one leg, as she was leaving, after everything had been agreed upon with Merla. She would not be getting out of her car for Merla. Merla would meet her at the corner. Merla would.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She, the lady, must have been curious or put off by the jumble of dirty things at my front door that I suppose she first noticed when she was leaving, or by the splendor of my living room just off from the jumble. She missed going inside of it to see what was going on in each of the pictures in there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What this woman had done to me was incalculable, and she had done it all in a period of time which had lasted no more than five minutes, which so many others have done, coming in here only for the telephone, because I had waved at her while she was shouting at Merla, I had said, &#x201c;Would it help you to know the number of <i>this</i> house?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I had told this little person my wrong address, not because I wanted to, nor because of any need on my part to make up a lie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said 2-7-0 which is way off the track, except for two digits, but I had rearranged them, the 7 and the 0, but I did not know I had done that. All that I knew was that I had done something unforgivably uncivil.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a lapse to reckon with. I took her into my arms, so that she could never leave me, and then jammed her up into the corner with the jumble by the front door and held her in there, exhausting myself to keep her in there. I didn&#x2019;t care. It hurt her more than it hurt me, to be a lady.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violence is never the problem.

He does not even like me. Except for once he took me, and my head was up almost under his arm, my neck was, and my hand went up his back and down his back, and he copied what I did to him on my back with his hand, so that I would know what it would be like, I would have an idea, and then I could run home to my marriage afterward, which is what I did before, after we were done with each other; and the way one thing leads to another in my mind, this means I should run to the man for more of it, but the way one thing leads to another, first I will tell my husband, &#x201c;I would not choose you for a friend,&#x201d; then I will run to the other man, so that I can hear him say the same thing to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unrequited love, which is always going around so you can catch it, and get sick with it, and stay home with it, or go out and go about your business getting anyone you have anything to do with sick, even if all that person has done is push the same shopping cart you pushed, so that she can go home, too, and have an accident, such as leaning over to put dishwasher powder into the dishwasher, so that she gets her eye stabbed by the tip of the bread knife, which is drip-drying in the dish rack.

They marched forward, ignoring the slack-jawed townspeople gaping at the banner they carried: a dragon with a forest curled within its talon, the emblem of the royal house. A palanquin draped in scarlet silk appeared, resting on the shoulders of four men. People craned their necks to see the occuï¿½pant, but caught only a tantalizing glimpse through the swaying curtain: blood-red lips, golden blossoms in shining hair, and robes that cost more than any of them would see in a lifetime. <br><br>&#x201c;Another day, another concubine.&#x201d; A bent old woman bared the three teeth she had left. &#x201c;It seems he has a taste for pretty village girls. May blessings rain down upon him,&#x201d; she added hastily, in case a soldier heard her criticize their sovereign. <br><br>&#x201c;He must not discriminate by class when it comes to beauty,&#x201d; another woman agreed. She was not as old as the first, but she was just as bent. Most of her weight rested on her good leg, while the other hung crookedly, like a dead branch. Her shrewd gaze moved from the proï¿½cession to the girl beside her.<br><br>She was not the only one looking at this girl. More than one soldier admired her as he marched by.<br><br>The girl wore tattered, faded clothing like everyone else. But she had a face like a painting: a perfect oval, with lotus lips blooming beneath a sweet stem of a nose. She appeared docile, virginal, but the eyes she lifted told a different story with their sparkle of intelligence. They were the kind of eyes that flashed from the shadows of a darkened room.<br><br>&#x201c;He must not discriminate,&#x201d; the woman said again. &#x201c;What do you say to that, Xifeng?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish the Emperor joy, Guma. She must be special indeed if he chose her for his own,&#x201d; the girl said respectfully, even as her coal-black eyes burned.<br><br>At the palace, slaves would bathe the young concubine&#x2019;s feet in orange flower water. Every inch of her would smell like jasmine, and when the Emperor put his lips on her skin, he would know nothing of her hardship and poverty&#x2014;the same hardship and poverty that coated Xifeng like sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;She is no more special than you.&#x201d; There was no love in Guma&#x2019;s statement, just fact. But they were mere words, ones she had said for years. She shuffled closer and hooked a claw-like hand around Xifeng&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Come. It may be silks and riches for <i>her, </i>but it&#x2019;s back to the needles for us. Tonight, we will read the cards again,&#x201d; she added as gently as she ever could.<br><br>Xifeng knew these rare glimpses of kindness from her aunt could be swept away the next minute by a dark mood. So she inclined her head in a show of grateful obedience, picking up the basket containing their meager purchases, and the pair trudged back home.<br><br>They lived a short distance from the center of town&#x2014;rather a grand term for a muddy square. There, ragged farmers and crones with more brains than teeth hawked wares that had seen better days: maggoty vegetables, cracked pottery, dull knives, and cheap hemp fabric.<br><br>It had rained the night before, a torrential downpour of early spring that would be good for the rice and crops but had turned all else into a pungent soup of mud and debris. A few scrawny chickens ran by, a trail of droppings streaking behind them, as a woman emerged from a soggy cottage to scream at her brats.<br><br>Some days, Xifeng thought she would gladly watch this town burn. She ached to leave it all behind and never look back. To think she was trapped here forever, while the Imperial palanquin carried that other girl straight into the Emperor&#x2019;s swan-feathered bed.<br><br>She felt Guma&#x2019;s sharp eyes on her and took care to keep her face neutral. To show discontent was to rebuke her aunt for all the sacrifices she had made. After all, Guma had not been required to raise the basï¿½tard daughter of a sister who had shamed their family and killed herself. And despite being eighteen, Xifeng knew any small sign of displeasure would earn her a dozen stripes with the bamboo cane. She flinched inwardly, thinking of the scars on her back that had just begun to heal.<br><br>And then there he was, walking toward them, as though her thoughts had conjured him.<br><br>Wei. The reason for those scars.<br><br>His proud, shaven head was turned away, watching the innkeeper across the street argue with a customer. His features were sharper in profile, brutal and beautiful, and the other men gave him a wide berth as he cut through the crowd. With his shoulders like a bull, bare arms that rippled with muscle, and ferocious storm of a gaze, he was the living embodiment of war. But those large, capable hands, which now carried a stack of rusted swords to be repaired&#x2014;Xifeng knew how genï¿½tle they could be. She remembered how they had felt on her skin and struggled not to shiver at the memory of it, because Guma&#x2019;s clever eyes were still watching to see her reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like for supper?&#x201d; Xifeng kept her voice steady, as though she didn&#x2019;t know the man approaching them at all.<br><br>Wei faced forward. He had noticed them now; her skin prickled with his awareness. She wondered if he would say something. He had an idea that because he was physically strong and Guma weak, he could overpower her and free Xifeng from her control forever. But there were different kinds of strength, and provoking Guma to release hers was the last thing they would want.<br><br>She patted her aunt&#x2019;s tense arm as though there were no one else dearer to her in the world. &#x201c;I could make a soup of these prawns. Or I could fry the turnips, if you prefer.&#x201d;<br><br>And then the moment passed. Wei walked by without a word. Xifeng reserved her sigh of relief to release later when she was in the kitchen, alone.<br><br>&#x201c;Do the prawns,&#x201d; Guma said calmly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re already beginning to smell.&#x201d;<br><br>A few steps more, and they arrived home.<br><br>Xifeng&#x2019;s grandparents had once owned the entire building with its handsome dark oak faï¿½ade and imposing doors carved with a phoenix rising. They had been successful tailors before the war, and Guma and her younger sister, Mingzhu, had grown up here. Xifeng found it more difficult to imagine Guma as a child than to picture the splendor that had long worn off these faded walls.<br><br>Despite the poor condition of the place, they had managed to rent the downstairs to a couple as a teahouse. Guma and Xifeng lived on the drafty upper floors with Ning, the girl they had hired to help them sew and embroider. She was waiting for them by the door, and though she was fifteen and scrawny, the glance she gave Wei&#x2019;s hard, retreating back was that of a woman. It was not the first time Xifeng had caught her gawking at him, but she had never seen the girl&#x2019;s longing so raw and sharp. She could practically feel the waves of lust radiating off her.<br><br>Xifeng felt something growl deep inside.<br><br>But before she could do or say anything, Guma released her arm and cracked a vicious slap across Ning&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;What are you doing there? I don&#x2019;t pay you to stand idling and ogling,&#x201d; she snapped as the girl touched her reddened cheek and sniffled. &#x201c;Get back upstairs.&#x201d;<br><br>Ning turned wet eyes to Xifeng before obeying, and though a note of pity rose up inside Xifeng, she remained silent. She knew that slap had been meant for <i>her, </i>but she had hidden her emotions so well that Guma had to vent her violence on the hired girl, like a teapot with built-up steam. She watched Ning slouch upstairs, both feeling sorry for her and thinking she deserved it if she thought she could steal Wei for herself.<br><br>But Xifeng&#x2019;s relief was short-lived. Guma grasped her arm again, pinching hard enough to leave a bruise. Her face had begun to wrinï¿½kle like a rotting pear, making her appear much older than her forty years. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I don&#x2019;t know you want the same thing from him,&#x201d; she hissed, her sour breath filling Xifeng&#x2019;s nostrils. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I don&#x2019;t know you still sneak around, no matter how many times I pull out that cane.&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng kept her eyes down, biting the inside of her cheek at the pain of Guma&#x2019;s fingernails, hatred boiling within her. No matter how hard she worked and how obediently she behaved, she received only scorn and beatings in return.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not good enough for you, do you understand? You deserve better.&#x201d; And though one hand still gripped Xifeng&#x2019;s arm, the other gently stroked her cheek.<br><br>That simple gesture, one a mother might make toward her daughter, dissolved the hatred in an instant. Xifeng leaned into her touch, forgetï¿½ting the pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Now help me upstairs, child.&#x201d;<br><br>The upper level had always seemed an endless labyrinth to Xifeng, even now as a grown woman. Once, these chambers had been full of purpose. Dried flowers still littered the floor of one room, where years ago they had hung from the rafters above vats of boiling water, ready to be made into fabric dyes. Across the hall, wisps of thread still clung to abandoned looms, unwilling to relinquish the past. The large room at the back had housed an army of hired girls, whose quick, clever hands had embroidered endless lengths of silk for noblewomen.<br><br>But those days were long gone. Nowadays, they used only four rooms: two for sleeping, one for cooking, and one for eating and sewï¿½ing. She led Guma to a stool in this last room, where Ning sulked and hemmed a square of cotton with blue-dyed thread.<br><br>&#x201c;Mind your stitches,&#x201d; Xifeng told her, earning a baleful glare.<br><br>Ning had come from one of the coastal villages, reeking of fish and poverty. Guma had hired her when she saw what she could do with a needle. Since then, the girl had become Xifeng&#x2019;s shadow, the irritating younger sister she&#x2019;d never had. Ning followed her, asking questions and imitating her movements, the way she spoke, and the style in which she arranged her hair. But there was a sense of competition, too, and Xifeng suspected the girl&#x2019;s interests had shifted from trying to impress Guma to making Wei look at her the way he looked at Xifeng.<br><br>Ning darted a frightened glance at her, and Xifeng realized she had been staring. She turned away, draping a length of pale pink silk over Guma&#x2019;s lap.<br><br>For weeks, they had been embroidering plum blossoms all over the fabric. Her aunt had sneered at the choice of color and design, which belied the humble origins of the lady who had commissioned the tunic for a banquet. Truly well-bred women preferred silks dyed darker colï¿½ors, which cost more. But Xifeng thought wistfully that she would wear the cheapest of silks if it meant she too could enjoy herself at some festival.<br><br>&#x201c;Go prepare the meal, and don&#x2019;t be long about it,&#x201d; Guma told her crossly. &#x201c;We need to finish this in two days, and you&#x2019;ve wasted too much time gawking at the new concubine.&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng held her tongue at this injustice. It was Guma who had wantï¿½ed to wait for the procession on this chilly spring morning, so she could compare her niece with the new addition to the Imperial harem.<br><br>&#x201c;Was she beautiful?&#x201d; Ning asked timidly.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Guma snapped, though she hadn&#x2019;t seen any more of the woman than anyone else. <br>&#x201c;Do you think the Emperor would choose an ugly girl like you to bear his children?&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng turned to hide her smile and carried the basket down the hall. Guma was right. Wei would <i>never </i>look at such a plain, moon-faced girl. Not when he had <i>her.</i><br> <i><br>But Ning didn&#x2019;t choose to look the way she does, </i>Xifeng thought, with another twinge of pity. <i>Any more than I did. </i>She put a pot of water on to boil, gazing at her own reflection.<br><br>She had seen that face every day for eighteen years in the washï¿½basin. She never needed to open her mouth. She never needed to do much. All it took was stepping out with that face, and she would get a wink from the innkeeper, the best cut of meat from the butcher, and a pretty bead or two from the tradesmen in the square. One of them had even given her a pomegranate once. Wei had been furious when she told him, and would have made her throw it away if she hadn&#x2019;t already brought it home to Guma.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ask for these things,&#x201d; she had protested, comparing it to his natural-born talent for metalworking. The town craftsman had hired him because he could shape a beautiful sword from the ugliest bronze. But still, Wei had been gruff and grim and unwilling to understand.<br><br>Perhaps the Emperor&#x2019;s new concubine had been born with a face like hers. Lovelier, even, since it had won her a home in the Imperial Palace.<br><br>The water began to boil, and Xifeng turned away bitterly to seaï¿½son the prawns. She sliced the last of the ginger and scallions, hoping their client would be satisfied with the pink silk and pay immediately. They couldn&#x2019;t afford more vegetables until then, and eating plain rice&#x2014;something they&#x2019;d had to do many times in the past&#x2014;always put Guma in a fearsome temper.<br><br>Xifeng carried the meal into the front room. They ate in peace, interï¿½rupted only once by Guma criticizing how she had cooked the prawns, and then worked until the sun went down.<br><br>She recited poetry as she worked, something Guma always required her to do. Her aunt had drummed into her head that poetry, calligraphy, and music marked a well-born lady, and so she had endured many a sleepless night to study. She would have resented it, had it not proven that Guma wanted and <i>expected </i>a better life for her.<br> <i><br>The moon shines down upon us, beloved</i><br> <i>The water a vast and eternal mirror </i><br> <i>A voice whispers from every tender branch</i><br> <i>Turn your face from the world&#x2019;s apple-blossom fragility</i><br> <i>And embrace this boundless night</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Guma paused in the midst of stitching a plum blossom petal, her nostrils flaring. &#x201c;Where did you learn that?&#x201d; she demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;From one of your volumes.&#x201d; Xifeng gestured to a dusty stack of fadï¿½ed texts in the corner, the meager remnants of her mother and aunt&#x2019;s school days.

All Xifeng knew of her mother was what she had been told only once: that Mingzhu had been beautiful and brainless and had gotten herself pregnant and abandoned by a nobleman. The pinched expression on Guma&#x2019;s face suggested she was thinking of her now, but when she spoke, it had nothing to do with her.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that poem.

Why, then, in this era of intense globalization, has there been a proliferation of violence, of ethnic cleansing on the one hand and extreme forms of political violence against civilian populations on the other?<p></p><p><i>Fear of Small Numbers</i> is Arjun Appadurai&#x2019;s answer to that question. A leading theorist of globalization, Appadurai turns his attention to the complex dynamics fueling large-scale, culturally motivated violence, from the genocides that racked Eastern Europe, Rwanda, and India in the early 1990s to the contemporary &#x201c;war on terror.&#x201d; Providing a conceptually innovative framework for understanding sources of global violence, he describes how the nation-state has grown ambivalent about minorities at the same time that minorities, because of global communication technologies and migration flows, increasingly see themselves as parts of powerful global majorities. By exacerbating the inequalities produced by globalization, the volatile, slippery relationship between majorities and minorities foments the desire to eradicate cultural difference.</p><p>Appadurai analyzes the darker side of globalization: suicide bombings; anti-Americanism; the surplus of rage manifest in televised beheadings; the clash of global ideologies; and the difficulties that flexible, cellular organizations such as Al-Qaeda present to centralized, &#x201c;vertebrate&#x201d; structures such as national governments. Powerful, provocative, and timely, <i>Fear of Small Numbers</i> is a thoughtful invitation to rethink what violence is in an age of globalization.</p></p><p>&#34;In this book, Appadurai follows up &#34;Modernity at Large&#34; with a look into the seamy side of globalization. Analyzing the growing inequalities and endemic violence of the past decade, he still sees signs of hope in less noticed trends of &#39;globalization from below.&#39; These are important new thoughts from an influential thinker of our times.&#34;--Partha Chatterjee, Director, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta, and Professor of Anthropology, Columbia University, New York<p>Arjun Appadurai is the John Dewey Professor in the Social Sciences at The New School, where he is also Senior Advisor for Global Initiatives.

As Frederick Douglass wrote: "When John Brown stretched forth his arm ... the clash of arms was at hand." DuBois's biography brings Brown stirringly to life and is a neglected classic.</p><p><br><strong>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., </strong>is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard University. He has edited several major reference works, including<em> Dictionary of African Biography, African American Lives,</em> <em>Africana, and African American National Biography.</em> In addition, he is Editor in Chief of the <em>Oxford African American Studies Center </em>(www.oxfordaasc.com).<br>Chapter I<br>Africa and America<br><br>&#x201c;That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying, Out of Egypt have I called My son.&#x201d;<br><br>The mystic spell of Africa is and ever was over all America. It has guided her hardest work, inspired her finest literature, and sung her sweetest songs. Her greatest destiny&#x2014;unsensed and despised though it be,&#x2014;is to give back to the first of continents the gifts which Africa of old gave to America&#x2019;s fathers&#x2019; fathers.<br>Of all inspiration which America owes to Africa, however; the greatest by far is the score of heroic men whom the sorrows of these dark children called to unselfish devotion and heroic self-realization: Benezet, Garrison, and Harriet Stowe; Sumner, Douglass and Lincoln&#x2014;these and others, but above all, John Brown.<br><br>John Brown was a stalwart, rough-hewn man, mightily yet tenderly carven. To his making went the stern justice of a Cromwellian &#x201c;Ironside,&#x201d; the freedom-loving fire of a Welsh Celt, and the thrift of a Dutch housewife. And these very things it was&#x2014;thrift, freedom, and justice&#x2014;that early crossed the unknown seas to find asylum in America. Yet they came late, for before them came greed, and greed brought black slaves from Africa.<br><br>The Negroes came on the heels, if not on the very ships of Columbus. They followed De Soto to the Mississippi; saw Virginia with D&#x2019;Ayllon, Mexico with Cortez, Peru with Pizarro; and led the western wanderings of Coronado in his search for the Seven Cities of Cibola. Something more than a decade after the Cavaliers, and a year before the Pilgrims, they set lasting foot on the North American continent.<br><br>These black men came not of their own willing, but because the hasty greed of new America selfishly and half-thoughtlessly sought to revive in the New World the dying but unforgotten custom of enslaving the world&#x2019;s workers. So with the birth of wealth and liberty west of the seas, came slavery, and a slavery all the more cruel and hideous because it gradually built itself on a caste of race and color, thus breaking the common bonds of human fellowship and weaving artificial barriers of birth and appearance.<br><br>The result was evil, as all injustice must be. At first the black men writhed and struggled and died in their bonds, and their blood reddened the paths across the Atlantic and around the beautiful isles of the Western Indies. Then as the bonds gripped them closer and closer, they succumbed to sullen indifference or happy ignorance, with only here and there flashes of wild red vengeance.<br><br>For, after all, these black men were but men, neither more nor less wonderful than other men. In build and stature, they were for the most part among the taller nations and sturdily made. In their mental equipment and moral poise, they showed themselves full brothers to all men&#x2014;&#x201c;intensely human&#x201d;; and this too in their very modifications and peculiarities&#x2014;their warm brown and bronzed color and crisp curled hair under the heat and wet of Africa; their sensuous enjoyment of the music and color of life; their instinct for barter and trade; their strong family life and government. Yet these characteristics were bruised and spoiled and misinterpreted in the rude uprooting of the slave trade and the sudden transplantation of this race to other climes, among other peoples. Their color became a badge of servitude, their tropical habit was deemed laziness, their worship was thought heathenish, their family customs and government were ruthlessly overturned and debauched; many of their virtues became vices, and much of their vice, virtue.<br><br>The price of repression is greater than the cost of liberty. The degradation of men costs something both to the degraded and those who degrade. While the Negro slaves sank to listless docility and vacant ignorance, their masters found themselves whirled in the eddies of mighty movements: their system of slavery was twisting them backwards toward darker ages of force and caste and cruelty, while forward swirled swift currents of liberty and uplift.<br><br>They still felt the impulse of the wonderful awakening of culture from its barbaric sleep of centuries which men call the Renaissance; they were own children of the mighty stirring of Europe&#x2019;s conscience which we call the Reformation; and they and their children were to be prime actors in laying the foundations of human liberty in a new century and a new land. Already the birth pains of the new freedom were felt in that land. Old Europe was begetting in the new continent a vast longing for spiritual space. So there was builded into America the thrift of the searchers of wealth, the freedom of the Renaissance and the stern morality of the Reformation.<br><br>Three lands typified these three things which time planted in the New World: England sent Puritanism, the last white flower of the Lutheran revolt; Holland sent the new vigor and thrift of the Renaissance; while Celtic lands and bits of lands like France and Ireland and Wales, sent the passionate desire for personal freedom. These three elements came, and came more often than not in the guise of humble men&#x2014;an English carpenter on the Mayflower, an Amsterdam tailor seeking a new ancestral city, and a Welsh wanderer. From three such men sprang in the marriage of years, John Brown.<br><br>To the unraveling of human tangles we would gladly believe that God sends especial men&#x2014;chosen vessels which come to the world&#x2019;s deliverance. And what could be more fitting than that the human embodiments of freedom, Puritanism and trade&#x2014;the great new currents sweeping across the back eddies of slavery, should give birth to the man who in years to come pointed the way to liberty and realized that the cost of liberty was less than the price of repression? So it was. In bleak December, 1620, a carpenter and a weaver landed at Plymouth&#x2014;Peter and John Brown. This carpenter Peter came of goodly stock, possibly, though not surely, from that very John Brown of the early sixteenth century whom bluff King Henry VIII of England burned for his Puritanism, and whose son was all too near the same fate. Thirty years after Peter Brown had landed, came the Welshman, John Owen, to Windsor, Conn., to help in the building of that commonwealth, and near him settled Peter Mills, the tailor of Holland. The great-grandson of Peter Brown, born in Connecticut in 1700, had for a son a Revolutionary soldier, who married one of the Welshman&#x2019;s grandchildren and had in turn a son, Owen Brown, the father of John Brown, in February of 1771. This Owen Brown a neighbor remembers &#x201c;very distinctly, and that he was very much respected and esteemed by my father. He was an earnestly devout and religious man, of the old Connecticut fashion; and one peculiarity of his impressed his name and person indelibly upon my memory: he was an inveterate and most painful stammerer&#x2014;the first specimen of that infirmity that I had ever seen, and, according to my recollection, the worst that I had ever known to this day. Consequently, though we removed from Hudson to another settlement early in the summer of 1807, and returned to Connecticut in 1812, so that I rarely saw any of that family afterward, I have never to this day seen a man struggling and half strangled with a word stuck to his throat, without remembering good Mr. Owen Brown, who could not speak without stammering, except in prayer.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1800, May 9th, wrote this Owen Brown: &#x201c;John was born, one hundred years after his great-grandfather. Nothing else very uncommon.&#x201d;</p><h2>Courageous Love: An Andrea Carter Book (Circle C Milestones)</h2><p><p>Andrea Carter is finally pulling her own weight on the Circle C Ranch she loves.

Jean Anderson and Hedy Wï¿½rz lead readers from the back roads of Bavaria to the vineyards on the Moselle, from a quaint subterranean tavern in Lï¿½beck to the three-star restaurants of Munich, opening kitchen doors and kettle lids to reveal modern Germany's gastronomic triumphs. <p> With explanations of ingredients, clear instructions, and evocative introductions to the recipes, the cooking of today's Germany is illuminated for American cooks. All the traditional dishes are here, many in their original robust versions and others cleverly lightened by German's new generation of chefs and home cooks. Potato salad, barely glossed with dressing, then greened with fresh chevil; sauerkraut teamed with cod; and pumpernickel reduced to crumbs and folded into an airy Bavarian cream are just a few of the creative new German dishes that nevertheless bow to tradition. A chapter on wine and beer by Lamart Elmore, former executive director of the German Wine Information Bureau, completes the picture of Germany's total gastronomic experience. </p><p> Germany today is a land of contradictions, a land where meandering rivers run alongside autobahns, where castles and cuckoo clocks coexist easily with high tech, high fashion, and haute cuisine. German food reflects this rich tapestry, and in <em>The New German Cookbook</em>, Jean Anderson and Hedy Wï¿½rz import and interpret the traditional and the subtle, flavorful, and sophisticated dishes of modern Germany for American cooks.</p></p><p><p>The winner of five best cookbook awards (Tastemaker, James Beard, IACP) and a member of the James Beard Cookbook Hall of Fame, Jean Anderson writes for <em>Bon Appï¿½tit</em>, <em>Food &amp; Wine</em>, <em>Cottage Living</em>, <em>Gourmet</em>, <em>More</em>, and other national publications. She lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.</p>German cooking may bring to mind images of rollicking Oktoberfests with dark beers hoisted, heaped meats downed and aprons aplenty. And while there may be some measure of truthful oom-pah-pah in this, Anderson and Wurz have gone to great lengths to propose a different view of German food today. The recipes here make use of foodstuffs typical of that nation: cabbage, game, pork, potatoes, fish and fruits. But these ingredients are combined to create a somewhat lighter--though by no means low calorie--cuisine that reflects international influences. Some recipes emerge from the latest generation of German chefs, whose work can be sampled in hotels and restaurants across Germany, but many come from private people who simply know--and know how to cook--good food. The authors provide an instructive glossary of German cooking and food terms, and their section on German beers and wines will be handy for dinner or lunch plans. Most of the recipes are best-suited to veteran cooks, but some will serve others honing their skills. This is an excellent introduction to a cuisine that has been overlooked, offering a good opportunity to turn out some schmackhaft (tasty) and verschieden (different) meals. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ringo: With a Little Help</h2><p><i>Ringo: With a Little Help</i> is the first in-depth biography of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr, who kept the beat for an entire generation and who remains a rock icon over fifty years since the Beatles took the world by storm. <i>With a Little Help</i> traces the entire arc of Ringo's remarkable life and career, from his sickly childhood to his life as The World's Most Famous drummer to his triumphs, addictions, and emotional battles following the breakup of the Beatles as he comes to terms with his legacy.<br><br>Born in 1940 as Richard Starkey in the Dingle, one of Liverpool's most gritty, rough-and-tumble neighborhoods, he rose from a hardscrabble childhood &#x2013; marked by serious illnesses, long hospital stays, and little schooling &#x2013; to emerge, against all odds, as a locally renowned drummer. Taking the stage name Ringo Starr, his big break with the Beatles rocketed him to the pinnacle of worldwide acclaim in a remarkably short time. He was the last member of the Beatles to join the group but also the most vulnerable, and his post-Beatles career was marked by chart-topping successes, a jet-setting life of excess and alcohol abuse, and, ultimately, his rebirth as one of rock's revered elder statesman.</p><p><b>Michael Seth Starr</b> (Northern New Jersey) is the TV Editor for <i>The New York Post</i>, where he's written about television for the past twenty years. He is a native of Northern New Jersey, and has authored biographies of Peter Sellers, Art Carney, Joey Bishop, Bobby Darin, Raymond Burr and Redd Foxx. And no &#x2013; he is <i>not</i> related to Ringo Starr.In this illuminating and comprehensive biography of Richard ''Ringo Starr'' Starkey, New York Post TV editor Starr delves into every aspect of the life of one of the 20th century's most famous drummers. Beatles fans may come away disappointed at the lack of truly new material regarding Ringo's tenure with the band, much of which is culled from the Beatles Anthology documentary. That said, Starr successfully paints a complete portrait of the legendary drummer, whose contributions to rock 'n' roll, he argues, have largely been overshadowed by his iconic bandmates. With aplomb, Starr creates an intimate picture of Liverpool and Hamburg during the 1950s and '60s that puts the rest of Ringo's life (including his later battles with alcoholism and drug addiction) into fascinating perspective. Starr's prose is straightforward, at times stilted, but frequent eyewitness accounts and quotes from original interviews with Ringo's friends and family help him succeed in revealing the nuanced and passionate man who was the backbone of the Beatles. --Publishers Weekly<br><br>It's a solid recounting of Ringo's life and will be of interest to Beatles fans looking for more information on the least-chronicled member of the Fab Four. -Booklist Online <br> <br> Extensive research and an injection of personality make this a definitive biography of the most underrated Beatle. -Foreword Reviews <br> <br> Until Ringo pens his memoirs (if he ever does), this biography will serve as the most complete and up-to-date telling of his life story. --Library Journal Xpress Reviews, June 26, 2015<br><br>''Through assiduous research, the author (no relation) paints a nuanced picture of Ringo as a charismatic, likeable character, whose flaws were opened by success.'' -MOJO Magazine <br><br>''Too few books have chronicled Ringo Starr's professional and personal life, but this new tome by Michael Seth Starr (no relation) thoroughly examines the drummer's story from his Liverpool beginnings to his current solo career'' -Something Else Reviews <br><br> ''Ringo: With a Little Help'' is clearly the definitive biography of one of the most famous musicians - or, heck, people - of the last century (though author Starr could not get subject Starr to participate). And, while he did get help along the way, Richard Starkey richly deserves this solid literary treatment. --Houston Chronicle</p><h2>Our Story: A Memoir of Love and Life in China (Pantheon Graphic Novels)</h2><p>Begun by the author when he was eighty-seven years old and mourning the loss of his wife, <i>Our Story </i>is a graphic memoir like no other: a celebration of a marriage that spanned the twentieth century in China, told in vibrant, original paintings and prose.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rao Pingru was twenty-four-year-old soldier when he was reintroduced to Mao Meitang, a girl he&#x2019;d known in childhood and now the woman his father had arranged for him to marry. One glimpse of her through a window as she put on lipstick was enough to capture Pingru&#x2019;s heart: a moment that sparked a union that would last almost sixty years.<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>Our Story </i>is Pingru and Meitang&#x2019;s epic but unassuming romance. It follows the couple through the decades, in both poverty and good fortune&#x2014;looking for work, opening a restaurant, moving cities, mending shoes, raising their children, and being separated for seventeen years by the government when Pingru is sent to a labor camp. As the pair ages, China undergoes extraordinary growth, political turmoil, and cultural change. When Meitang passes away in 2008, Pingru memorializes his wife and their relationship the only way he knows how: through painting. In an outpouring of love and grief, he puts it all on paper. Spanning 1922 through 2008, <i>Our Story </i>is a tales of enduring love and simple values that is at once tragic and inspiring: an old-fashioned story that unfolds in a nation undergoing cataclysmic change.<br><br><i>(With gorgeous full-color illustrations throughout, and a distinctive exposed spine emulating the original Chinese design.)</i></p><p><b>RAO PINGRU</b>&nbsp;was born in 1922. He lives in Shanghai, China.<br><br><i>Translated from the Chinese by Nicky Harman.</i>My first clear memories are of the ceremony that marked the formal start of my schooling. I was eight years old.<br>&nbsp;<br>First, the right day had to be chosen. When it arrived, I was woken by a servant at about three o&#x2019;clock in the morning. I washed and dressed, and went to the main hall of our house, where everything was prepared: my father, mother, and the gentleman who was to initiate me into the mysteries of education were standing by the tablet that honored Confucius. In the stillness of the night, the candlelight lent an air of great solemnity to the occasion, and I felt a thrill of excitement. But what really made me happy were the Four Treasures of Study, the brand-ï¿½new brush, ink, paper, and inkstone laid out on the writing desk. The gentleman in question was my &#x201c;Uncle Huang,&#x201d; and we were related by marriage: his eldest daughter was married to my big brother. His full name was Huang Xiaopu and he was at that time chief judge at the Hunan Province Supreme Court. His calligraphy was beautiful. He grasped my hand and together we traced the first lesson: lines of characters dedicated to the greatest educator of all, Confucius. He gripped my hand painfully hard, but I did not dare make a sound.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was the custom for the very first characters written during this ceremony to be put away carefully by one&#x2019;s mother. Afterward, we went to the sitting room, where an array of drinks and food were laid out down one side of the room. The steam which rose from the dishes of hot food seemed especially designed to dispel the seriousness of the moment. After our meal, my big brother took me to school. As we walked through the silent streets, the first light of dawn was visible in the sky. It was bitingly cold.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was our first year in Nanchang city. My father was a lawyer and we lived in a house by Chenjia Bridge. It was not a good location, but there were complicated reasons why we were there: my father&#x2019;s younger sister had married a man from a wealthy family. But unbeknownst to her family, the man to whom she had been given in marriage was in poor health, and, scarcely a year later, she was widowed and mother to a baby daughter, my cousin. For this reason, my father was determined to take good care of his younger sister. One evening when my cousin was five, on the anniversary of her father&#x2019;s death, her nanny, a fearsome old woman, took the little girl to the ceremonies that were being carried out to placate his spirit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Go on! Go and see! Your daddy&#x2019;s come!&#x201d; The old woman screamed at my cousin and pushed her forward. My cousin was so traumatized by this experience that she lost her wits. Although she did marry and have children, she was never happy.<br>&nbsp;<br>My aunt had a relative who was investing in various ventures, and she borrowed 8,000 yuan to put in and became his partner. I do not know whether the ventures really lost money, but I do know that she was unable to pay the loan back. Then she mortgaged the house at Chenjia Bridge but was still unable to manage and asked my father to rent it from her. And that was why we spent eight years there.<br>&nbsp;<br>After dinner every day, Third Brother and I (the two youngest children in the family) would go to my mother&#x2019;s bed, where she told us stories. They were mostly traditional tales about morality: about Min Ziqian,1 who was obedient to his stepmother even though she treated him badly, and about Six-ï¿½Feet Alley, the story of how a wise minister resolved a boundary dispute in Imperial China.2 I still remember the emotion on her face as she got to the bit where Min Ziqian begs his father not to repudiate his cruel stepmother:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;If Mother stays at home, only I have to endure the cold. But if you divorce Mother, all three of us children will suffer the cold.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And her laughter as she explained the last two lines of &#x201c;Six-ï¿½Feet Alley.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our family was originally from Nancheng county, Fuzhou district, Jiangxi province. Nancheng dates back to ancient times, to the days when Liu Bang ruled as the first Han dynasty emperor, and Nancheng belonged to Yuzhang district.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Xu River flowed north through old Nancheng; the town walls were built on the west bank of the river, and there were gates to the north, south, east, and west. Within the town, there was North Street, South Street, East Street, and West Street. The last was the longest. Our home was on North Street. The east bank was the outskirts of the town, so once you crossed Peace Bridge, there was less to see and fewer people around. The town and surrounding countryside were crisscrossed with waterways, like the veins of a leaf, and encircled by serried ranks of beautiful jade-ï¿½green peaks. Among the most famous were Magu Mountain and Conggu Mountain. There is a Song dynasty poem which goes<br><br> <i>Flourishing fields of wheat and green, green mountains, a winding road.</i><br> <i>The land of the South, stretching a thousand li, brings tears to the eyes in spring.</i><br> <i>Mother Xu stands at the river crossing, calls to the ferryman, points far off to the third valley, Mayuan.<br></i><br>Seen through a poet&#x2019;s eyes, the charm of my hometown had not changed much since the days of the Song dynasty: cocks crowed and dogs barked, the boatmen sang as they plied their oars, and the landscape of waterways and mountains had remained the same for generation after generation.<br>The &#x201c;Mayuan&#x201d; of the poem is the largest of the valleys of Magu Mountain, and legend has it that this is where Magu, the Hemp Goddess, practiced Daoism. Magu was a legendary Daoist immortal, apparently just a girl of eighteen or nineteen when she saw with her own eyes the bed of the East Sea rise up and turn into dry land and mulberry fields three times. No doubt I was influenced by the legend, because to my mind there was a cosmic feel about the Mayuan valley.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was another reason why Mayuan was special to me: the land was very ï¿½fertile&#x2014;it was where the so-ï¿½called silver pearl or cold water white rice was cultivated&#x2014;ï¿½and my mother bought a piece of land there and put the title deed in my name. I never saw it firsthand but my father told me it was about twenty mu (three acres). Mayuan valley was also where my father&#x2019;s father was buried. After my mother died, she was buried beside my grandfather, to his left, in a slightly smaller grave. In 1958, the local government built a reservoir in the valley; the mulberry fields really did become an azure sea, and the two graves vanished beneath its waters.<br>&nbsp;<br>For ordinary people in Nancheng, life was as lively as it always had been in such fertile regions. My grandfather wrote a poem about it:<br><br> <i>The husband has gone to Ningzhou to buy green tea, the wife plants new squash behind the ferry landing.</i><br> <i>The boy, with no work to do, rows to a mossy bank by night, lights pine resin, <br>plays at will-ï¿½o&#x2019;-ï¿½the-ï¿½wisp.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>There were four distinct seasons in Nancheng. In the words of the Song dynasty monk-ï¿½poet Hui Kai: &#x201c;White flowers in spring, the moon in autumn, cool breezes in summer, snow in winter. If you have no cares, then all the seasons are good.&#x201d; A child has no cares, and, during holidays, times really were good. Whether it was the Grave-ï¿½Sweeping Festival, the Start of Summer, the Dragon Boat Festival, the Double Seventh, the Midautumn Festival, or the Double Ninth, there would be much more food and drink than normal. And this was probably the chief reason why we children loved festivals.<br><br>In Nancheng county, there was a traditional way of celebrating the Start of Summer Festival, called &#x201c;Push into Summer.&#x201d; As the rhyme went: &#x201c;Push hard into summer, push hard into summer, raise your energy.&#x201d; The character &#xb0d1;, cheng, which Nancheng folk pronounced with the fourth tone, meant &#x201c;push in hard.&#x201d; The grown-ï¿½ups would tell us, laughing: &#x201c;You kids can eat as much as you like today, it&#x2019;s Push into Summer day. But after today, no more stuffing your faces!&#x201d; After the Start of Summer Festival, the weather got a lot hotter and we ate less, and had lighter meals. The festival was marked by another folk custom too. In my family, it was called &#x201c;the weigh-ï¿½in&#x201d;: the cook and the driver brought out an enormous balance scales, and we boys, Third Brother and I, and Qingzeng and Shaoï¿½zeng (my older brother&#x2019;s sons), were all put on it to be weighed. When summer was over, we were weighed again, we never knew quite why. I imagine that since we ate less in summer, we lost weight and were at risk of falling ill, and this was a way of confirming that we were in good health.<br>&nbsp;<br>Girls did not need to be weighed, so my niece Yunqin was able to avoid the weigh-ï¿½in.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the Dragon Boat Festival, according to the county annals, there used to be dragon boat races held along the river by the Peace Bridge. They must have been lively affairs, but sadly I never saw them myself. The Dragon Boat Festival lye zongzi dumplings, however, left a big impression on me. In my family, we used to have something else for breakfast, and then eat our zongzi and hard-ï¿½boiled eggs and garlic tops at noon. Lye water, made by filtering water through rice straw ash, was added to the glutinous rice grains. The dumplings were made by wrapping the rice in leaves and tying them tightly with string. These were then put in to cook. When they were soft, the dumplings were thick and solid, pale yellow in color. We ate them dipped in brown sugar, and they were indescribably delicious. Meiï¿½tang and I both used to eat these when we were little, but for decades after we came to Shanghai, we never tasted them. Then in 2003, quite by chance, I saw them on sale in the Fuhua Lou store near our home and quickly bought some to share with Meiï¿½tang. At that time, we felt that there was not enough lye in them, and they were not as tasty and sticky as they had been back home.<br>&nbsp;<br>The evening of the Midautumn Festival, our family put a square table in the courtyard, covered by a crimson tablecloth on which were laid incense sticks, candles, and fruit. The centerpiece of course was the mooncakes. Nancheng mooncakes were thin and slightly flattened, about the diameter of a rice bowl, although there were bigger ones too. They were filled with rock candy, red and green candied fruit strips, walnuts, and ground-ï¿½up melon seeds. White sesame seeds were scattered on top, and the character for month, &#x58a9;, was written in black sesame seeds. If the mooncakes were a larger size, then the four characters for &#x201c;Midautumn Mooncake,&#x201d; &#x6ad3;&#xd5ec;&#x58a9;&#xae70;, were written on them. They were hard and sweet, and had their own special flavor.<br>&nbsp;<br>The festival that we children most enjoyed was Chinese New Year. For a whole month beforehand, the family was busy making preparations. First, we bought fish and meat for salting and curing. The food was prepared, and the house swept and cleaned, and every member of the family got new clothes. My little brother and I had long silk gowns made for us, generally in plain dark blue or green.<br>&nbsp;<br>The evening of the twenty-ï¿½third day of the twelfth lunar month, incense and candles were lit and my father would lead my brothers and me to the kitchen to pay our respects to the kitchen god. We set off firecrackers and scattered short lengths of rice straw mixed with millet. The belief was that the kitchen god worked there all through the year, keeping a close eye on what we did and how we behaved, until on this evening he got on his horse and rode up into the sky to deliver his report to the Jade Emperor. These broken bits of rice straw and millet were meant to feed his horse on its journey.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was a solemn ceremony, with the adults of the family calling out, &#x201c;Ah . . . lu-ï¿½lu-ï¿½lu . . .&#x201d; as they flung the straw into the air to encourage the horse to eat its fill and get the journey off to a good start.<br>&nbsp;<br>We also made offerings to the kitchen god, including some of the local malt sugar. Malt sugar, made from rice, and sticky and sweet, was designed to sweeten his words in his report about us, so it was essential. All the same, to make quite sure he did not forget, we pasted reminders to the left and right of his effigy. The couplets read:<br>&nbsp;<br> <i>When you go to heaven, talk of our good deeds;</i><br> <i>When you return to earth, bring us peace.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>On the twenty-ï¿½fourth of the twelfth lunar month, called the &#x201c;little year,&#x201d; we ate vegetarian dishes and made offerings to the ancestors. By this time, we had been busy making preparations for two weeks or more, and everything was largely ready, so we could begin to enjoy the New Year celebrations.<br>&nbsp;<br>For us children, this was the most enjoyable time of all&#x2014;ï¿½there was the delicious anticipation of a holiday that was imminent but had not yet arrived.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the &#x201c;little year,&#x201d; we were always given a bowl of &#x201c;scalded meat and thread noodles&#x201d; to eat. Thread noodles, a kind of vermicelli, and the meat, in the form of small meatballs, were placed in boiling water, then taken off the flame and served the instant they were cooked. Simple but good. These noodles are what I remember best of the &#x201c;little year.&#x201d;</p><h2>Home on Apple Blossom Road (Life In Icicle Falls)</h2><p>www.SheilasPlace.com<br><br><b>Home is where the love is...&nbsp;</b><br><br>Colin Wright and Mia Blair grew up in Icicle Falls, but they left years ago&#x2014;and not on good terms.

Russell Bernard Published On: 2017-08-10<br><br><p>What do rumours, viruses and global trade have in common? They are all transmitted through a network. For some, this is the start of thinking how all networks share similar properties. For me, such platitudes are getting passï¿½; of course networks are everywhere! Finally, this book goes beyond superficial commonalities in networks to provide a coherent framework for the many different kinds of social networks available to the researcher. The authors help us understand which differences matter, how to analyse them and how to make sense of the results. These days its easy to be sold on the power of network analysis, but it is much harder to know which analysis to do and why. Thankfully, Borgatti, Everett and Johnson have given us a text that is as conceptually rich as it is methodologically generous.&nbsp;</p> Author: Bernie Hogan Published On: 2017-08-11</p><h2>The Art of Nursing</h2><p>Using rich nursing narratives from practicing nurses as well as scholarly conceptual sources, this book paints a vivid picture of the diversity and richness embodied in the artful practice of nursing. These stories illustrate the forms of knowledge used by nurses and demonstrate essential nursing concepts, such as care, spirituality, presence, compassion, self-care, and advocacy. Readers will also examine obstacles that can interfere with their successful performance as a nurse and discover ways of overcoming these challenges.</p><p>Carolyn Cooper, PhD, RN, School of Nursing, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC</p><h2>The Shaping of Grand Strategy: Policy, Diplomacy, and War</h2><p>Within a variety of historical contexts, The Shaping of Grand Strategy addresses the most important tasks states have confronted: namely, how to protect their citizens against the short-range as well as long-range dangers their polities confront in the present and may confront in the future. To be successful, grand strategy demands that governments and leaders chart a course that involves more than simply reacting to immediate events. Above all, it demands they adapt to sudden and major changes in the international environment, which more often than not involves the outbreak of great conflicts but at times demands recognition of major economic, political, or diplomatic changes. This collection of essays explores the successes as well as failures of great states attempting to create grand strategies that work and aims at achieving an understanding of some of the extraordinary difficulties involved in casting, evolving, and adapting grand strategy to the realities of the world.</p><p>Grand strategy demands that governments and leaders chart a course that involves more than simply reacting to immediate events.

Certainly we do not think it is the basis of the mind. We think of stories and parables from <em>Aesop's Fables</em> or <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em>, for example, as exotic tales set in strange lands, with spectacular images, talking animals, and fantastic plots--wonderful entertainments, often insightful, but well removed from logic and science, and entirely foreign to the world of everyday thought. But Mark Turner argues that this common wisdom is wrong. The literary mind--the mind of stories and parables--is not peripheral but basic to thought. <em>Story</em> is the central principle of our experience and knowledge. <em>Parable</em>--the projection of story to give meaning to new encounters--is the indispensable tool of everyday reason. Literary thought makes everyday thought possible. This book makes the revolutionary claim that the basic issue for cognitive science is the nature of literary thinking. <br><br>In <em>The Literary Mind</em>, Turner ranges from the tools of modern linguistics, to the recent work of neuroscientists such as Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman, to literary masterpieces by Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Proust, as he explains how story and projection--and their powerful combination in parable--are fundamental to everyday thought. In simple and traditional English, he reveals how we use parable to understand space and time, to grasp what it means to be located in space and time, and to conceive of ourselves, other selves, other lives, and other viewpoints. He explains the role of parable in reasoning, in categorizing, and in solving problems. He develops a powerful model of conceptual construction and, in a far-reaching final chapter, extends it to a new conception of the origin of language that contradicts proposals by such thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. Turner argues that story, projection, and parable precede grammar, that language follows from these mental capacities as a consequence. Language, he concludes, is the child of the literary mind.<br><br>Offering major revisions to our understanding of thought, conceptual activity, and the origin and nature of language, <em>The Literary Mind</em> presents a unified theory of central problems in cognitive science, linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. It gives new and unexpected answers to classic questions about knowledge, creativity, understanding, reason, and invention.<br></p><p>Named an Outstanding Academic Book of 1997 by <i>Choice</i>.A fuller presentation of the book and its relationship to current research in cognitive science, linguistics, and literary theory is available at http://www.wam.umd.edu/~mturn</p><h2>Biology Now</h2><p><p><strong>The perfect balance of science and story&#x2015;written with NGSS in mind</strong></p> Brief chapters are written to teach science through engaging stories, combining compelling science with intriguing anecdotes.

God bless all who sail in her.'<br>P. J. Matthews, Irish Times (Dublin)</p><h2>The Allure of Battle: A History of How Wars Have Been Won and Lost</h2><p>History has tended to measure war's winners and losers in terms of its major engagements, battles in which the result was so clear-cut that they could be considered "decisive." Marathon, Cannae, Tours, Agincourt, Austerlitz, Sedan, Stalingrad--all resonate in the literature of war and in our imaginations as tide-turning. But were they? As Cathal J. Nolan demonstrates in this magisterial and sweeping work, victory in major wars usually has been determined in other ways. Even the most legendarily lopsided of battles did not necessarily decide their outcomes. Nolan also challenges the hoary concept of the military "genius," even of the Great Captains--from Alexander to Frederick and Napoleon--mapping instead the descent into total war.<br><br><em>The Allure of Battle</em> systematically recreates and analyzes the major campaigns among the Great Powers, from the Middle Ages through the 20th century, from the fall of Byzantium to the defeat of the Axis powers, tracing the illusion of "short-war thinking," the hope that victory might be swift and conflict brief. Such has almost never been the case. Even one-sided battles have mainly contributed to victory or defeat by accelerating erosion of the other side's defenses, resources, and will.<br><br>Massive conflicts, the so-called "people's wars," beginning with Napoleon and continuing until the end of World War II, have been more fundamentally determined by prolonged stalemate and attrition, wars in which the determining factor was not tactical but industrial.<br><br>Nolan's masterful book places battles squarely and mercilessly within the context of the wider conflict in which they took place. In the process it help corrects a distorted view of their role in war, replacing popular images of "decisive battles" with somber appreciation of the sacrifice and endurance necessary to victory. Accessible, provocative, exhaustive, and illuminating, <em>The Allure of Battle</em> will spark fresh debate about the history and conduct of warfare.<br></p><p><br><strong>Cathal J. Nolan </strong>is Associate Professor of History and Executive Director of the International History Institute at Boston University. In addition to editing six books on international history, Nolan is the author of <em>Principled Diplomacy: Security and Rights in U.S. Foreign Policy </em>and <em>Wars of the Age</em> <em>of Louis XIV</em>. He is also the sole author of several multi-volume encyclopedias on military and international history.<br><p>Allure of Battle is winner of the 2017 Gilder Lehrman Prize for Military History. This major book prize &#x201c;recognizes the best book on military history in the English-speaking world distinguished by its scholarship, its contribution to the literature, and its appeal to both a general and an academic audience.&#x201d;<br> <br>"With considerable elegance, Mr. Nolan disposes of iconic military genius, putting particular stress on the importance of defensive battle.... He suggests that his book is not written for military historians but for the wider public, in part to alert the general reader to the distorted image of decisiveness in battle. He is too modest: Everyone can benefit from what is a particularly fine history of war." -- Ian Beckett, The Wall Street Journal.<br><br>"Fascinating. I cannot remember reading anything in the last few years that has made me reconsider so many basic questions -- What wins wars? What is the most illuminating way to relate military history? Are our generals flailing because they try to substitute battlefield skill for strategic understanding?" Thomas E. Ricks, The New York Times.<br><br>"This is one of the most valuable military histories in years. A must-read for students of military history. " -- Kirkus Reviews (Starred review).<br><br>"One of the most stimulating and controversial books on military history in a long time. Challenging, well written, well-sourced ... there is a great deal of food for thought for military historians and professionals in this volume." -- New York Journal of Books.<br><br>"Brilliant new book ... sets narrative force firmly against romantic nonsense. Keeps before readers the central fact that earlier, grander military histories - for which Nolan's book is a worthy but distinctly modern counterpart - were so often at pains to obscure: that the allure of battle is nightmare." -- The National.<br><br>"Nolan does not merely write from the point of view of the commander. He recreates the atmosphere of battle, the valor and misery of common soldiers and bystanders caught in the tempest of war. His masterful writing and attention to detail, combined with a rare ability to write succinctly and never lose the larger picture, will fascinate historians and general readers alike." -- Danny Orbach, History and Asian Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br><br>"Crisply written, well-designed and executed ... Cathal Nolan's work is a monumental effort. Highly recommended to serious students of war, especially senior officers who must balance the planning of wars with the material resources needed to execute them. As we reenter an era marked by the potential scale of great power competition, it would behoove our policymakers to read and consider Professor Nolan's findings." -- Modern War Institute at West Point, Frank Hoffman, Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies.<br><br>"In a sweeping narrative that ranges from the Middle Ages through World War II, Cathal Nolan dismantles an illusion that has persistently distorted our understanding of armed conflict - that of the decisive battle engineered by the genius general. But the importance of this brilliantly provocative book is not merely historical. Its conclusions apply directly to war and military policy in the present day." -- Andrew J. Bacevich, Author of America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History.</p> <p> <br>"A lyrical, sweeping, and fast-paced return to grand military history with the important proviso that the allure of battle has constantly misled generals, politicians and historians to mistake rousing tactical victories for long-term and enduring strategic gains. In exacting detail, Cathal Nolan pushes myopia aside and the result is a trenchant reappraisal of decisive battles in Western warfare." -- Michael L. Gross, The School of Political Science, University of Haifa, the author of Moral Dilemmas of Modern War and The Ethics of Insurgency.<br><br>"This is a book that military planners and general/flag officers should read, and it should be required reading for anyone assigned to the National Security Council. Most military professionals like to think of themselves as maneuver warriors; this book shows the dark side of maneuver warfare." -- Gary Anderson, Elliott School of International Affairs.<br><br>"Why do so many generals over promise and under-deliver, from Breitenfeld to Basra? We buy the hype because we want quick results at low cost. Yet the blood-sodden reality is almost always quite different. In seeking the Allure of Battle, Cathal Nolan draws on the broad sweep on Western military history. He explains what went wrong, and why, with wit, insight, and a knowing eye for the heroes and cads who made it so. Battles rarely deliver convincing results. But Cathal Nolan sure does." -- Daniel P. Bolger, Lieutenant General, U.S. Army, Retired, author of Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.<br><br>The Allure of Battle provides new and fresh insights into war studies and offers new and fresh perspectives on military history. This is a very well-researched book. Nolan's credentials on the subject are unmatched. It will change the way you have looked at military history up until now. It is a must-read for both students and experts of military history.-- The Washington Book Review<br> <br>"This is a really interesting book. It is thought-provoking and offers readers numerous side suggestions on places to go if they are interested in exploring various topics at greater length. Buy it. Read it." RealClearBooks.com<br><br>"Nolan provides an important historical overview for modern military and political leaders tempted by the siren song of war and under the delusion that conflict will be short-lived under the right commander." Military History<br><br>"Nolan&#x2019;s book offers insight to the business strategist and the war strategist.<br>We see the tangible takeaways in business through both insight into the limitations of decisive battle mentalities, and the power of what a deep capacity for logistics can bring to an organization&#x2019;s staying power capabilities." MinimumViableStrategy.com<br><br>"A significant and welcome contribution to the scholarship of military history and theory by clarifying the seductions of short-war thinking and lionized military 'geniuses.'" Michigan War Studies Review<br><br>"Can be read as a kind of frontal assault on Clausewitz&#x2019;s domination of the way Westerners think about war, and the way most popular historians write about it, i.e., with a very heavy emphasis on battles. It&#x2019;s a plea to remember that battles are but one of many factors that explain how and why wars are won and lost. Grand strategy &#x2014;where political and military spheres intermix&#x2014;industrial mobilization and management, logistics, the maintenance of public support for the government, attrition of forces in the field&#x2014;all these factors, and more, ultimately affect war&#x2019;s trajectory and outcome. To focus intensively on battles is to oversimplify war&#x2019;s inherent complexity." thedailybeast.com</p></p><h2>Speech Acts: An Essay in the Philosophy of Language</h2><p>Written in an outstandingly clear and lively style, this 1969 book provokes its readers to rethink issues they may have regarded as long since settled.</p><p>&#34;Written in an outstandingly clear and lively style, it provokes its readers to rethink issues they may have regarded as long since settled.&#34; TLS&#39;This small but tightly packed volume is easily the most substantial discussion of speech acts since John Austin&#39;s How To Do Things With Words and one of the most important contributions to the philosophy of language in recent decades.&#39;--Philosophical Quarterly</p><h2>Academic Transformation: The Road to College Success (Mystudentsuccesslab)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Learning Frameworks (such as Applied Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology), Effective Learning, Learning to Learn, and Student Success.</i> </p> <p> <i> <br> </i> </p> <p> <b> <i>Academic Transformation&nbsp;</i> </b>uses the latest neurobiological research to help students master both cognitive and self-regulation skills for college success.

Hi, Mom!<br></p><h2>Violence: A Micro-sociological Theory</h2><p><p>In the popular misconception fostered by blockbuster action movies and best-selling thrillers--not to mention conventional explanations by social scientists--violence is easy under certain conditions, like poverty, racial or ideological hatreds, or family pathologies. Randall Collins challenges this view in <i>Violence</i>, arguing that violent confrontation goes against human physiological hardwiring. It is the exception, not the rule--regardless of the underlying conditions or motivations.</p><br><p> Collins gives a comprehensive explanation of violence and its dynamics, drawing upon video footage, cutting-edge forensics, and ethnography to examine violent situations up close as they actually happen--and his conclusions will surprise you. Violence comes neither easily nor automatically. Antagonists are by nature tense and fearful, and their confrontational anxieties put up a powerful emotional barrier against violence. Collins guides readers into the very real and disturbing worlds of human discord--from domestic abuse and schoolyard bullying to muggings, violent sports, and armed conflicts. He reveals how the fog of war pervades all violent encounters, limiting people mostly to bluster and bluff, and making violence, when it does occur, largely incompetent, often injuring someone other than its intended target. Collins shows how violence can be triggered only when pathways around this emotional barrier are presented. He explains why violence typically comes in the form of atrocities against the weak, ritualized exhibitions before audiences, or clandestine acts of terrorism and murder--and why a small number of individuals are competent at violence.</p><br><br><p> <i>Violence</i> overturns standard views about the root causes of violence and offers solutions for confronting it in the future.</p></p><p><p>"Covering infinitely recurrent strips of social action running from blustering confrontation to intimate physical attack, <i>Violence</i> is peppered with breakthrough insights, demonstrating the power of systematic theory and even concluding with that rarest of sociological contributions, a short list of eminently practical suggestions. The concept of 'forward panic' alone makes the book indispensable. This book is a milestone contribution to criminology, to micro-sociology, to the sociology of emotions, and to a field that knows no academic boundaries: the history of efforts to control violence. Randy Collins has developed a framework that should guide a generation of research."<b>--Jack Katz, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"I have no doubt that this book will be hailed as one of the most important works on violence ever written. After reading it, it is difficult any longer to imagine that all that is needed for violence to occur is a motive to engage in violence. Collins argues persuasively that the situation must also be right if violence is actually to occur."<b>--Donald Black, author of <i>The Social Structure of Right and Wrong</i></b></p><p>"A masterful study of the microdynamics of violence. This book will undoubtedly provoke excitement and controversy among a wide group of readers, including educated nonspecialists as well as academics, journalists, law-enforcement professionals, and policymakers.

Most of the books available in working with this population are written from a traditional 'play therapy' point of view. The Gestalt Therapy-based approach provides a more effective method for psychotherapeutic work with children of all ages. The focus is on the relationship between the therapist and client, rather than observation and interpretation. It is a vigorous, dynamic approach.Violet Oaklander uses a wide variety of creative, expressive and projective techniques in her work, and each chapter reflects and exemplifies the use of this work in the service of therapy. The approach is applicable to a wide variety of ages, as well as individual, family and group settings. The book will interest child and adolescent psychotherapists, psychologists, social workers, counselors, interns, school personnel as well as graduate-level students. Parents may also find it helpful, as well as adults who are interested in the child within.</p><p>Violet Oaklander"<i>Hidden Treasure</i> is an essential text for all play therapy practitioners and students. It is a work of great wisdom that distils the vast experience of Violet Oaklander's work with children of all ages and adolescents. The many, many practical examples fully illustrate the application of Gestalt principles in building successful therapeutic relationships to enable the children to discover their true inner selves. This inspiring work will surely become a major landmark in the field just as <i>Windows to Our Children</i> emerged some thirty years ago." (Monika Jephcott, President)<br><br>"Hidden Treasure will sit happily alongside <i>Windows to Our Children</i> on the shelves of practitioners around the world. It offers a gentle and developmentally appropriate approach to helping children heal&#x2015;and to helping adults understand children."

In this stimulating volume, Roger Scruton offers a comprehensive account of the nature and significance of music from the perspective of modern philosophy. The study begins with the metaphysics of sound. Scruton 7istinguishes sound from tone; analyzes rhythm, melody, and harmony; and explores the various dimensions of musical organization and musical meaning. Taking on various fashionable theories in the philosophy and theory of music, he presents a compelling case for the moral significance of music, its place in our culture, and the need for taste and discrimination in performing and listening to it. Laying down principles for musical analysis and criticism, this bold work concludes with a theory of culture--and a devastating demolition of modern popular music.<br><br>"A provocative new study."--<em>The Guardian</em><br></p><p><br><strong>Roger Scruton</strong> is a leading authority on aestheics, and has also published books on others aspects of philosophy, politics, literature, architecture, and modern culture.

Renaissance science has frequently been approached in terms of the progress of the exact sciences of mathematics and astronomy, to the neglect of the broader intellectual context of the period. Conversely, those authors who have emphasized the latter frequently play down the importance of the technical scientific developments. In this book, Professor Debus amalgamates these approaches: The exact sciences of the period are discussed in detail, but reference is constantly made to religious and philosophical concepts that play little part in the science of our own time. Thus, the renewed interest in mystical texts and the subsequent impact of alchemy, astrology, and natural magic on the development of modern science and medicine are central to the account. Major themes that are followed throughout the book include the effects of humanism, the search for a new method of science, and the dialogue between proponents of the mystical-occult world view and the mathematical-observational approach to nature.</p><p>An integrated introduction to science and medicine from the mid-fifteenth to the mid-seventeenth century.

Parts I and II of the text examine planar and three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics in research, issues of body segment parameters and forces, and energy, work, and power as they relate to analysis of two- and three-dimensional inverse dynamics. Two of the chapters have been extensively revised to reflect current research practices in biomechanics, in particular the widespread use of Visual3D software. Calculations from these two chapters are now located online with the supplemental software resource, making it easier for readers to grasp the progression of steps in the analysis. </p><p> In part III, readers can explore the use of musculoskeletal models in analyzing human movement. This part also discusses electromyography, computer simulation, muscle modeling, and musculoskeletal modeling; it presents new information on MRI and ultrasound use in calculating muscle parameters. Part IV offers a revised chapter on additional analytical procedures, including signal processing techniques. Also included is a new chapter on movement analysis and dynamical systems, which focuses on how to assess and measure coordination and stability in changing movement patterns and the role of movement variability in health and disease. In addition, readers will find discussion of statistical tools useful for identifying the essential characteristics of any human movement. </p><p> The second edition of <i>Research Methods in Biomechanics</i> explains the mathematics and data collection systems behind both simple and sophisticated biomechanics.

The key difference is often held to be that the Greeks and Romans practiced a "Western Way of War," in which the aim is an open, decisive battle--won by courage instilled, in part, by discipline. Here, Harry Sidebottom looks at how this Western Way of War was constructed and maintained by the Greeks and Romans and why this concept is so prevalent today.<br><br>All aspects of ancient warfare are thoroughly examined--from philosophy and strategy to the technical skills needed to fight. Sidebottom examines war in the wider context, showing how wars were able to shape classical society, and how an individual's identity was sometimes constructed by war, as in the case of the Christian soldier fighting in God's name. He also explores the ways in which ancient society thought about conflict: Can a war be just? Why was siege warfare particularly bloody? What role did divine intervention play in the outcome of a battle? Taking fascinating examples from the <em>iliad</em>, Tacitus, and the Persian Wars, Sidebottom uses arresting anecdotes and striking visual images to show that any understanding of ancient war is an ongoing process of interpretation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harry Sidebottom</strong> is Lecturer in Ancient History at Merton College, Oxford, and part-time lecturer in Classics and Ancient History at the University of Warwick.

Harry Sidebottom fairly presumes that you wouldn't know a hoplite if one thrust a spear at you, and that you grasped legionary tactics from watching the DVD of Gladiator. The book manages to cover practical fighting from<br>the Iliad to Islam's challenge to Byzantium; war as personal and state metaphor in Greece and Rome; strategy and motivation on sea and land; and then nips briskly on to historians' re-evaluations of the above - in 128 neat pages plus extra reading list and a wicked chronology.

In this classic volume, based on a series of ground-breaking lectures given to the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture in 1938, Dr. Shewhart illuminated the fundamental principles and techniques basic to the efficient use of statistical method in attaining statistical control, establishing tolerance limits, presenting data, and specifying accuracy and precision.<br>In the first chapter, devoted to statistical control, the author broadly defines the three steps in quality control: specification, production, and inspection; then outlines the historical background of quality control. This is followed by a rigorous discussion of the physical and mathematical states of statistical control, statistical control as an operation, the significance of statistical control and the future of statistics in mass production.<br>Chapter II offers a thought-provoking treatment of the problem of establishing limits of variability, including the meaning of tolerance limits, establishing tolerance limits in the simplest cases and in practical cases, and standard methods of measuring. Chapter III explores the presentation of measurements of physical properties and constants. Among the topics considered are measurements presented as original data, characteristics of original data, summarizing original data (both by symmetric functions and by Tchebycheff's theorem), measurement presented as meaningful predictions, and measurement presented as knowledge.<br>Finally, Dr. Shewhart deals with the problem of specifying accuracy and precision &#x2014; the meaning of accuracy and precision, operational meaning, verifiable procedures, minimum quantity of evidence needed for forming a judgment and more.<br>Now available for the first time in this inexpensive paperbound format, this highly respected study will be welcomed by mathematics students, engineers, researchers in industry and agriculture &#x2014; anyone in need of a lucid, well-written explanation of how to regulate variable and maintain control over statistics in order to achieve quality control over manufactured products, crops, and data.</p><p></p><h2>Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America</h2><p>Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America was published in 1950 and describes in detail the trees and shrubs in the deciduous forests of Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. It is still widely used as a reference work today. Lucy Braun was perhaps the foremost botanist in the deciduous forest region. Her descriptions of the deciduous forest associations, from mixed mesophytic to beech-maple, are wonderful, a classic title in plant ecology. Emma Lucy Braun (1889-1971) was an American botanist and ecologist whose commitment to conservation led to the eventual preservation of over 10,000 acres in Ohio. Much of this land was carefully studied by Braun and her students and the plant life cataloged for posterity. Braun&#39;s devotion to land preservation was one of the pivotal influences in the developing field of ecology. Her extensive research on plants was a major impetus in establishing plant ecology as an academic discipline and The Ecology Society of America elected Braun its first woman president in 1950.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science</h2><p><p>One of the most creative philosophers of the 20th century, Rudolf Carnap presented a series of science lectures at the University of California in 1958. The present volume is an outgrowth of that seminar, which dealt with the philosophical foundations of physics. Edited by Martin Gardner from transcripts of Carnap's classroom lectures and discussions, the book remains one of the clearest and soundest introductions to the philosophy of science.<br>Specially designed to appeal to a wide range of readers, <i>An Introduction to thePhilosophy of Science </i>offers accessible coverage of such topics as laws and probability, measurement and quantitative language, the structure of space, causality and determinism, theoretical laws and concepts and much more. Stimulating and thought-provoking, the text will be of interest to philosophers, scientists and anyone interested in logical analysis of the concepts, statements and theories of science. Its clear and readable style help make it "the best book available for the intelligent reader who wants to gain some insight into the nature of contemporary philosophy of science" <i>&#x2015; Choice. </i>Foreword to the Basic Books Paperback Edition, 1974 (Gardner); Preface (Carnap); Foreword to the Dover Edition (Gardner). 35 black-and-white illustrations.

Martin West investigates their traditional mythologies, religions, and poetries, and points to elements of common heritage. In The East Face of Helicon (1997), West showed the extent to which Homeric and other early Greek poetry was influenced by Near Eastern traditions, mainly non-Indo-European. His new book presents a foil to that work by identifying elements of more ancient, Indo-European heritage in the Greek material. Topics covered include the status of poets and poetry in Indo-European societies; meter, style, and diction; gods and other supernatural beings, from Father Sky and Mother Earth to the Sun-god and his beautiful daughter, the Thunder-god and other elemental deities, and earthly orders such as Nymphs and Elves; the forms of hymns, prayers, and incantations; conceptions about the world, its origin, mankind, death, and fate; the ideology of fame and of immortalization through poetry; the typology of the king and the hero; the hero as warrior, and the conventions of battle narrative.</p><p><br>M.L. West is Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.<br>Review from previous edition: "Martin West has written the definitive book on Indo-European language and religion...[the]...world of words is beautifully laid out for us in this important book."<br><br>--London Review of Books<br><br>"This volume...is written with the grace, style and wit that we have come to expect...the picture that emerges is detailed and consistent...the results are fascinating... West has done a great service in providing an accurate and up-to-date account."<br><br>--Richard Janko, TLS<br><br>"It is a book for repeated consultation rather than a quick read through...a landmark publication in an area of study whose importance is likely to grow - not only for classics but also for the humanities more generally."<br><br>--Bryn Mawr Classical Review</p><h2>Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art</h2><p><p>The understanding and enjoyment of a work of art depends as much on the story it depicts as on the artist's execution of it. But what were once biblical or classical commonplaces are not so readily recognizable today. This book relates in a succinct and readable way the themes, sacred and secular, on which the repertoire of Western art is based. Combined here in a single volume are religious, classical, and historical themes, figures of moral allegory, and characters from romantic poetry that appeared throughout paintings and sculpture in Western art before and after the Renaissance. More than just a dictionary, this text places these subjects in their narrative, historical, or mythological context and uses extensive cross-referencing to enhance and clarify the meanings of these themes for the reader.</p> <p>The definitive work by which others are compared, this volume has become an indispensable handbook for students and general appreciators alike. This wholly redesigned second edition includes a new insert of images chosen by the author, as well as a new preface and index to highlight the ideas, beliefs, and social and religious customs that form the background of much of this subject matter.</p></p><p>James HallIt is clearly written, well arranged, and can be read for its own sake as a compendium of the image-making faculty of Western man. I would recommend it strongly to anyone who wishes to increase his interest and pleasure in visiting a picture gallery or turning over the illustrations of a book of art.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b>Kenneth Clark</b><br><br> Of the several comparable dictionaries on the iconography of Western art . . . this one is by far the most satisfactory. This much richer fund of material as well as the tightly packed and well-written entries convey much information. In all, an impressively erudite yet thoroughly useable dictionary for which students and faculty alike should be grateful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br> The volume is comprehensive to interested laymen, and should be quite useful for students and scholars. Entries pertain to persons, titles and pictures, and objects as attributes and symbols. Recurrent mythological, historical and religious themes are explored and allegorical, poetic, and saintly characters are also covered. Cross references and appropriate line drawings enhance the book's value. And because the entries are succinct and really absorbing, it's fun simply to browse through this dictionary. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Library Journal</i></b></p><h2>Selected Poems: With Parallel German Text (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Rilke is one of the leading poets of European Modernism, and one of the great twentieth-century lyric poets in German. From <em>The Book of Hours</em> in 1905 to the <em>Sonnets of Orpheus</em> written in 1922, he constantly probed the relationship between his art and the world around him, moving from the neo-romantic and the mystic towards the precise craft of expressing the everyday in poetry. This new edition--the only bilingual edition to include such a broad range of poems--fully reflects Rilke's poetic development. It contains the full text of the <em>Duino Elegies</em> and the <em>Sonnets to Orpheus</em>, and selected poems from <em>The Book of Images, New Poems</em>, and earlier volumes, and from the uncollected poetry 1906-26. The translations are accurate, sensitive, and nuanced, and are accompanied by an introduction and notes that chart the development of Rilke's poetic practice and his central role in modern poetry. The book also includes a chronology, select bibliography, and explanatory notes that identify people and places, and include key commentary by Rilke from letters or notes.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The explanation for this is quite simple: the elite perceived majority power as tantamount to a dictatorship of the proletariat. <br><br>In ancient Greece there can be traced not only the rudiments of modern democratic society but the entire Western tradition of anti-democratic thought. In <em>Democracy</em>, Paul Cartledge provides a detailed history of this ancient political system. In addition, by drawing out the salient differences between ancient and modern forms of democracy he enables a richer understanding of both. <br><br>Cartledge contends that there is no one "ancient Greek democracy" as pure and simple as is often believed. <em>Democracy</em> surveys the emergence and development of Greek politics, the invention of political theory, and-intimately connected to the latter- the birth of democracy, first at Athens in c. 500 BCE and then at its greatest flourishing in the Greek world 150 years later. Cartledge then traces the decline of genuinely democratic Greek institutions at the hands of the Macedonians and-subsequently and decisively-the Romans. Throughout, he sheds light on the variety of democratic practices in the classical world as well as on their similarities to and dissimilarities from modern democratic forms, from the American and French revolutions to contemporary political thought. Authoritative and accessible, Cartledge's book will be regarded as the best account of ancient democracy and its long afterlife for many years to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Cartledge</strong> is A.G.

Geography has always been important, though it has had only a short history as an academic discipline and is much misunderstood. Modern Geography has come a long way from its historical roots in exploring foreign lands, in mapping the world and in describing the physical and human features of the Earth's surface. There are two parts to the discipline: Physical Geography, which covers natural environments and landscapes; and Human Geography, which investigates people and the cultural landscape. Physical and human geographers commonly do not agree with each other. But there are also common elements and Geography as a whole has an important role as a bridge between the sciences and the humanities. Using wide-ranging examples, the book paints a broad picture of the current state of Geography, its subject matter, concepts and methods, how it developed, and its strengths and weaknesses. The book's conclusion is no less than a manifesto for Geography's future.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

Conventional training methods often fail dog owners, but Katz argues that we know our dogs better than anyone else possibly could, and therefore we are well suited to train them. It is imperative, he says, that we think rationally and responsibly about how we choose, train, and live with the dogs we love, and the more we learn about ourselves, the better we can recognize their wonderful animal natures. Misinterpreting dogs is a profound obstacle to understanding them. <br><br>Katz believes that both people and dogs are unique&#x2013;a chow differs from a Lab just as a city dweller differs from a farmer&#x2013;and he describes how such individuality isn&#x2019;t addressed by even the best and most popular training methods. Not every training theory is for everyone, notes Katz, but almost anyone can train a dog and live with him comfortably. Katz on Dogs is filled with no-nonsense advice and answers to such key questions as: <br><br>ï¿½ What kind of dog should I have? Is there is a specific breed or kind of dog for my personality, family, or living situation?<br>ï¿½ What is the best way to train a dog?<br>ï¿½ Can I trust my vet?<br>ï¿½ How often (and for how long) can a dog be left alone?<br>ï¿½ Is it preferable to have only one dog, or are more better?<br>ï¿½ What are the secrets to successful housebreaking?<br>ï¿½ What are my dogs thinking, if anything?<br>ï¿½ How can I walk my dog instead of having her walk me? <br>ï¿½ Is it ever okay to give away a dog you love?<br>ï¿½ When is it time to put my dog down?<br><br>Katz draws from his own experience, his interactions with thousands of dog owners, vets, breeders, dog rescue workers, trainers, and behaviorists, and he has tested his approach with volunteer dog owners around the country. Their helpful and often inspiring stories illustrate how all of us can live well with our dogs. You can do it, Katz contends. You can live a loving and harmonious life with your dog.</p><p>Jon Katz has written fourteen books&#x2013;six novels and eight works of nonfiction&#x2013;including A Dog Year, The New Work of Dogs, The Dogs of Bedlam Farm, and Katz on Dogs. A two-time finalist for the National Magazine Award, he has written for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, and the AKC Gazette. A member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, he writes a column about dogs for the online magazine Slate and is co-host of &#x201c;Dog Talk,&#x201d; a monthly show on Northeast Public Radio. Katz lives on Bedlam Farm in upstate New York and in northern New Jersey with his wife, Paula Span, who is a Washington Post contributing writer and a teacher at Columbia University, and their dogs.

Acquiring a dog in America is disturbingly<br>simple. You can trawl online, find a breeder, or take one of the puppies<br>some kid is offering outside the supermarket (I wouldn&#x2019;t advise it). You<br>might come across a stray while out walking or driving.<br>Some people seek dogs for rock-hard practical reasons: security,<br>hunting, therapy, search-and-rescue. But most of us, say psychologists<br>and behaviorists, have more complicated emotional and psychological<br>motives.<br><b>WHY DO I WANT A </b>1 <b>DOG?<br></b>The more trouble humans have connecting with one another, the<br>more they turn to dogs (and other pets) to fill some of the gaps. We seem<br>to need to love and be loved in ways that are uncomplicated, pure, and<br>dependable.<br>Contemporary America is, in many ways, a fragmented, detached<br>society. Our extended families have moved away; we often don&#x2019;t know<br>our neighbors; many of us hole up at night, staring at one kind of screen<br>or another. Divorce is commonplace. Work has become unstable, uncertain<br>for many, often unpleasant. Many people seem to find it easier to<br>live and interact with dogs than with one another, and so the bonds between<br>humans and dogs grow steadily stronger.<br>Yet this development in the relationship of these two species is onesided.<br>Many dogs are well served by humans&#x2019; deepening attachment, but<br>the dogs can&#x2019;t make similar choices. It&#x2019;s human need that has spawned<br>the great canine love affair.<br>Humans have decided to bring dogs into the center of their lives.<br>For all the fussing about animal rights, dogs have none. They don&#x2019;t get<br>to make consumer decisions. They&#x2019;re dependent on us for everything<br>they need to survive. They can&#x2019;t talk back; they have no say about their<br>environments or futures.<br>Although dogs have helped and worked with humans for thousands<br>of years, it&#x2019;s only in recent decades that they&#x2019;ve come to be seen as<br>something other than (perhaps more than) animals. Pet-keeping was<br>popular among the wealthy and powerful in medieval times, notes animal<br>ethicist James Serpell in the book <i>Animals and Human Society:<br>Changing Perspectives, </i>but it didn&#x2019;t acquire widespread respectability<br>until the late seventeenth century, a time of growing enthusiasm for science<br>and natural history and increased concern for animals&#x2019; welfare.<br>Since then, our attachment to dogs has intensified significantly. We<br>humans have never been closer to another species. We spend tens of billions<br>of dollars on their care, feeding, and amusement; give them human<br>names; talk to them as if they can understand us; believe we know what<br>they are telling us in return.<br>This emotionalism often entangles dogs in our needs and wants. It<br>is commonplace now, though it would have been shocking even a gen-<br><br>eration ago, to hear people say&#x2014;without apology or embarrassment&#x2014;<br>that they love their dogs more than they love most people, that they see<br>their dogs as members of their family, that they confide their most intimate<br>problems and secrets to their dogs, who are more loyal and understanding<br>than parents, spouses, lovers, or friends. Spending a few days<br>in a vet&#x2019;s office as part of my research for a book, I was amazed to hear<br>one woman after another urge, &#x201c;Look, Doctor, I can live without my<br>husband, but you&#x2019;ve got to save this dog!&#x201d; Yet vets tell me they hear it<br>all the time.<br>And not just from women. Behavioral research shows that women<br>love dogs in part because they seem emotionally supportive yet complex,<br>able to understand their owners in a profound though wordless<br>way. Meanwhile, men love dogs because they are perfect pals, happy to<br>go places and do things, but unable to hold or demand conversations.<br>Like it or not, our dogs&#x2019; upbringings reflect our own. We tend to<br>treat our dogs the way we were treated, or the way we wish we &#x2019;d been.<br>Either way, our own pasts profoundly shape our attitudes about dogs<br>and the ways we train and communicate with them.<br>This is usually an unconscious process. Few owners bring much<br>self-awareness to their canine relationships or reflect on their own families<br>when they scream at their dogs to come, or coo at them as if they<br>understood. One school nurse I know grabbed her dog by the ears<br>every night when she came home, yelling, &#x201c;Do you love me? Am I your<br>sweet mommy?&#x201d; She wondered why the dog tried to run off during<br>walks.<br>So the motives for getting a dog become important, if you are worried<br>about its welfare and want a good relationship. Is your answer to<br>the why-a-dog question that it&#x2019;s easier to seek companionship from a<br>dependent animal than from a person? Do you want a dog because of<br>subliminal messages from TV and movies? Are you more drawn to rescuing<br>creatures than to training and living with them?<br>Do we discipline in ways we were disciplined, ask for the levels of<br>obedience and perfection demanded of us, criticize them in the voices<br>and words we heard? Are we reenacting old family dramas, trying to<br>heal traumas? Can we honestly say that we or somebody else in our<br><br>household is willing to take emotional responsibility for a dog, not only<br>loving but training and caring for it?<br>A woman named Susan told me she wanted a dog because she felt<br>unsafe in a gritty, impoverished neighborhood in Elizabeth, New Jersey.<br>So she got an English mastiff so enormous that her landlord soon made<br>her give him away, then a German shepherd named Thunder. The dog<br>does effectively protect the house, charging the front door when<br>strangers come by. But since Susan, who works as a New Jersey Transit<br>conductor, concedes she is a poor trainer with little interest in working<br>with the dog, she has to lock Thunder in the basement when friends or<br>relatives visit. She &#x2019;s come home to find countless pieces of shredded<br>mail; the dog understandably sees envelopes coming through the door<br>slot as a menace. She &#x2019;s also had to replace scratched doors and broken<br>windows.<br>By now, Thunder weighs ninety pounds and pulls Susan all over the<br>sidewalk when she takes him out. The neighbors and their children are<br>terrified of him, though he&#x2019;s never actually bitten or harmed anyone.<br>The dog doesn&#x2019;t seem aggressive so much as conscientious; he is doing<br>the job he was hired to do, a victim of his own effectiveness. But Susan,<br>who says she loves Thunder, concedes that she never really wanted a<br>dog for its own sake. She probably should have taken a self-defense<br>course or called a security-alarm company instead. &#x201c;It would be cheaper<br>in the long run, and easier.&#x201d;<br>Understanding the reasons we want a dog is central to choosing the<br>right ones, training them properly, living with them happily. The more<br>we understand about ourselves, the better choices we are likely to make<br>for both species.<br>When you think about it, you probably know plenty of people who<br>complain that their dogs are too active or too sedentary, too interested in<br>chasing squirrels or too distracted to come when called, too protective<br>of the house or so nonthreatening they&#x2019;d help carry out the valuables.<br>Though the dog usually gets the blame, as often as not the owner made<br>an unfortunate or ill-considered choice. Consequently, the dog is under<br>pressure to be something other than what it is, while the humans have<br>their hands full. With a little thought and research, the lives of dogs and<br>their people can be a lot easier and more satisfying. But that does require<br>some understanding of one&#x2019;s own psychology and emotions, some<br>thought about where we are in our own lives and how our dogs fit in.<br>Jim, a hunter who lives near me in upstate New York, keeps three<br>beagles in a large kennel 360 days a year. They emerge for a few morning<br>hours on the other five days to track game. They spend a lot of time<br>waiting, but when their time comes, they shoot out of the kennel and<br>into the woods. &#x201c;They are great dogs,&#x201d; says Jim, who hasn&#x2019;t even<br>named them.<br>Does he like having them? I asked him once. &#x201c;When they do their<br>jobs I do,&#x201d; was his response. I feel reflexively sorry for the dogs when I<br>drive by, especially when I consider my own dogs&#x2019; pampered lives, but<br>Jim&#x2019;s dogs, while they&#x2019;re loud, don&#x2019;t seem to know they are deprived.<br>Not all dogs could live that way. But Jim&#x2019;s beagles demonstrate the<br>startling adaptability of dogs. They&#x2019;re there to hunt, period. Jim has a<br>wife and four children to whom he&#x2019;s devoted, and he&#x2019;s busy with his construction<br>firm; he doesn&#x2019;t need dogs to be his hobby or his confidants.<br>Once a day, he heads out to the kennel with a bucket of meat and<br>leftovers and tosses the contents into the kennel. At Christmas, he adds<br>a bucket of biscuits. They get all their shots, and see a vet if they&#x2019;re ailing.<br>The beagles have never been inside his home. He speaks of them<br>proudly and fondly, but they&#x2019;re tools, like a drill or a new rifle, not little<br>people, not even really pets in the contemporary sense.<br>Yet the dogs seem content and healthy. Jim knows precisely why he<br>wants them. They understand the simple rules and, since dogs lack<br>human awareness of the passage of time, don&#x2019;t know how long they go<br>between hunts. It may not be the way many of us would wish to have<br>dogs, but his clarity about the kinds of dogs he wants and why seems to<br>work well for everyone involved.<br>Then there&#x2019;s Andrea, an artist who lives on a fifty-acre farm in Vermont.<br>For various complex reasons, she &#x2019;s given up on the idea of men,<br>marriage, a family; instead, she sought out a collie rescue group. She,<br>too, understood exactly why she wanted a dog, and the bond she&#x2019;s<br>formed with hers appears to make them both happy.<br><br>&#x201c;I have not been fortunate with relationships, at least not yet,&#x201d; she<br>says. &#x201c;But Whisper and I adore each other. I have so much fun with her,<br>and she gives me so much comfort and love. I hope she &#x2019;s a bridge to another<br>relationship, but if she isn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll be okay.&#x201d;<br>It isn&#x2019;t for me to say&#x2014;and in truth I can&#x2019;t really decide&#x2014;whether<br>Andrea made a wise or healthy choice. But she thought about her motives,<br>about how a dog would fit into her life, and she made a considered<br>decision.<br>&#x201c;Because my kid&#x2019;s been begging for one&#x201d; is, on the other hand, usually<br>a suspect reason to acquire a pet. It&#x2019;s a common refrain, but dogs<br>bought as Christmas surprises for demanding children often have a<br>rough time of it. Promises get made and forgotten; interest in the newcomer<br>peaks, then wanes.<br>Not always. A twelve-year-old neighbor of mine asked for a golden<br>retriever last year for Christmas and his parents agreed, on the condition<br>that Jeremy take responsibility for it. Perhaps they had confidence that<br>he actually would because he&#x2019;d already proved his commitment by<br>feeding his fish and cleaning out hamster cages.<br>In any event, Jeremy does take care of Clancy. He walks him before<br>and after school, feeds him, brushes him, takes him to training<br>classes every Saturday. Each day after school, Jeremy and Clancy<br>train together. The dog has learned to come when called, to sit, stay,<br>and lie down on command. People in rural areas familiar with 4-H<br>programs know how healthy it can be for children to take responsibility<br>for animals. People in child- and dog-crazed suburbs&#x2014;where the<br>rule often seems to be, the smaller the yard, the bigger the dog&#x2014;<br>know how unusual it is. For Jeremy, getting a dog does seem like a<br>positive thing; he kept his word, or perhaps his parents took the unusual<br>step of insisting that he keep it. Either way, I&#x2019;ve encountered<br>few kids like him. Parents, beware: somebody in a household has to<br>take primary responsibility for a dog, and if the kids don&#x2019;t, Mom or<br>Dad has to step in.<br>Parents often give their kids things they think are good for them&#x2014;<br>cell phones, computers, dogs&#x2014;without much thought about how these<br>things will be used or treated after the purchase.<br><br>So why <i>do </i>you want a dog?<br>If the answer, in part, stems from a complex emotional history (as is<br>certainly the case with me), make sure you understand and think<br>through just what it is you are asking of a pet.<br>Despite our habit of anthropomorphizing dogs, they don&#x2019;t<br>understand what we &#x2019;re thinking and can&#x2019;t possibly grasp the nuances of<br>the emotional roles we sometimes ask them to fill. They can&#x2019;t even behave<br>amiably&#x2014;by our definitions&#x2014;if not properly chosen, exercised,<br>and trained. Since our expectations are usually much too high, we become<br>easily disappointed or angry. There&#x2019;s substantial evidence that<br>we&#x2019;re <i>creating </i>problem dogs&#x2014;biters, chewers, barkers, neurotics in<br>need of antidepressants. This happens partly because so many people<br>get the wrong dogs at the wrong times for the wrong reasons.<br>There&#x2019;s a moral component to taking on a dog. Though they aren&#x2019;t<br>capable of higher-level thought processes, dogs certainly have emotions.<br>They experience pain and loss, fear and affection. This has given<br>them and other animals some moral standing among people of conscience.<br>It may not make them the equivalent of children, but it does obligate<br>us to think about how we treat them. But every dog isn&#x2019;t <i>for<br></i>everyone. I don&#x2019;t accept the growing, politically driven notion that<br>every dog is equally deserving of rescue, that all dogs are essentially<br>alike in their adaptability to our tense, crowded, litigious human environment.<br>I don&#x2019;t find that to be true. Dogs are ferociously idiosyncratic, varying<br>wildly depending on breed, genetics, litter experience, treatment,<br>and environment. Some are genial and calm, bred for temperament, and<br>some are violent, bred and trained to hunt or fight. Few of us have the<br>training skills or time to alter all of those behaviors. The wrong choice<br>of dog can prove a nightmare for you, your family, and your community;<br>the right one, a joy.<br>Some dogs need to work, some don&#x2019;t; some will hide from thunder<br>while others won&#x2019;t even notice it; some hate people in hats and others<br>chase bikes. You can&#x2019;t always know these oddities in advance; all the<br>more reason to proceed with caution.<br><br><b>THE BEDLAM FARM CHECKLIST FOR<br>PROSPECTIVE DOG OWNERS<br></b>&#x25a0; <i>Get the dog you want. </i>The abuse of animals in general, and<br>dogs in particular, has led lots of owners to the conviction<br>that the only moral option is to save a dog from a pound,<br>where he faces euthanasia. It can be a wonderful experience<br>to rescue a dog (my rescued border collie Orson is<br>lying beneath my desk), but, like dog ownership itself, it&#x2019;s<br>not for everybody. It can also be a wonderful experience to<br>find a great dog from a good breeder. I have two of those,<br>as well: one herds sheep and runs my farm, and the newest,<br>Clem, suffuses my home and life with sweet companionship.<br>I smile almost every time I look at her.<br>Nobody can dictate what kind of dog you ought to get,<br>certainly not I.

Waiting for full dark even better. A sunny Tuesday morning was hardly the best time for scuttling up the courthouse steps and sliding behind one of the massive columns&#x2014;not if I wanted to call myself &#x201c;sneaky.&#x201d;</p><p>I hesitated at the bottom of the steps. My friends and former colleagues back in Springfield, Illinois, might not think so, but from where I stood Blue Plum, Tennessee, bustled. Crowds didn&#x2019;t jostle me, but in the way of small towns, as long as <i>anyone</i> was around, there was a chance that someone would see something and mention it to two or three others. The problem was partly my own fault. If I&#x2019;d completed this measuring assignment for TGIF sooner, I wouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about being surreptitious in broad daylight now. Then again, if we&#x2019;d included the courthouse in our original plan, I would have had weeks, not days, to get it done. The occasional criminal investigation aside, TGIF (Thank Goodness It&#x2019;s Fiber&#x2014;the needle arts group that met at the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat) was not an organization ordinarily dedicated to furtive operations, though, so I didn&#x2019;t want to let the others down now, as we prepared for our first-ever clandestine fiber installation event.</p><p>The way to sneak successfully, I decided, was to act normal. Eyes open, not casting shifty glances left and right. Shoulders square, not hunched as though ready to creep. Air of confidence. Relaxed smile.</p><p>A familiar-looking woman came down the stairs toward me. Her face didn&#x2019;t jog a name from my memory, but I liked the popcorn stitch cardigan she wore and I smiled as she passed.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Kathy, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; she asked, turning back to me.</p><p>&#x201c;Close,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Just Kath.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope you know how lucky you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky to have the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat. Your grandmother made the right decision in leaving the shop to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I keep meaning to stop in. Later this week, though. Not today&#x2014;must rush.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great&#x2014;&#x201d; Before I could say anything more, her rush carried her away.</p><p>I walked up the dozen worn limestone steps, looking for all the world like anyone else on her way to renew car tags, attend a trial, or probate a will. But at the top, rather than follow an older couple across the portico and through the doors, I stopped, turned around, and pretended to enjoy my elevated view of Main Street.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t really have to pretend. The streetscape, a mix of mostly Federal and Victorian architecture, looked and felt exactly right to me. Pink and purple petunias spilled from half-barrel planters along the brick sidewalks. Window boxes with red geraniums and sweet potato vines brightened storefronts. Looking right, I saw the bank and half a dozen office buildings and shops and, down at the end of the next block, the sign for the public library. To the left, along past Mel&#x2019;s cafï¿½, my own shop, the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat, basked in the morning sun. This view, this town, had been part of my life through all my childhood summers when I&#x2019;d come to visit my grandmother in her hometown. Now, thanks to her generosity in leaving me her house and the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat, Blue Plum was my hometown, too.</p><p>I watched Rachel Meeks, the banker, deadhead a couple of geraniums in the planters at the bank&#x2019;s door. Somewhere in her mid- to late fifties, Rachel&#x2019;s business suit mirrored her straightforward business sense. Apparently so did her sense of gardening decorum. She carried the withered flowers inside with her. I strolled to the end of the portico, still looking out over the street and assuming I looked casual, then sidled around behind the last column where I&#x2019;d be in its shadow and couldn&#x2019;t be seen from the steps or the door. There I took a coil of string from a pocket in my shoulder bag.</p><p>A second pair of hands to hold one end of the string would have helped. Unfortunately my favorite second pair of hands had other business that morning. Joe&#x2014;the Renaissance odd-job-man-about-town who&#x2019;d worked his way into my heart&#x2014;had gone over the mountains early to deliver half a dozen fly rods he&#x2019;d built for an outfitter in Asheville. That was just as well; two of us fiddling around a column would draw more attention. I took a roll of painter&#x2019;s tape from my bag, tore off an inch-long piece, and pressed it over the end of the string, sticking it to the column at about waist height.</p><p>The plan was to circle the column with the string and mark the string where it met itself again, then remove the tape, recoil the string, return string and tape to my bag, and retreat to the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat. I&#x2019;d barely started around the column, though, when a familiar voice made me pull back out of sight.</p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Weems, ma&#x2019;am&#x2014;<i>oof</i>&#x2014;now, that was uncalled for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a quack, and I&#x2019;ll tell anyone who asks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s step on inside, then, ma&#x2019;am, and you can tell the sheriff.&#x201d;</p><p>I inched around the column in time to see Joe&#x2019;s uniformed and starched brother, Deputy Cole Dunbar, ushering a tiny, elderly woman through the courthouse doors. The woman, Mayor Palmer &#x201c;Pokey&#x201d; Weems&#x2019; mother, wore tennis shoes, and it was a good thing. As she passed Joe&#x2019;s brother, she hauled off and kicked his shin. He winced, but there was no second &#x201c;oof.&#x201d; That led me to believe the first &#x201c;oof&#x201d; had been a reaction to a different kind of assault&#x2014;maybe a swift connection between Ms. Weems&#x2019; pocketbook and his midsection.</p><p>Snickering at someone else&#x2019;s pain isn&#x2019;t nice, even if that person is a clod. And even though Cole Dunbar would always be &#x201c;Clod&#x201d; to me, I was fairly sure I <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> snickered. But before the door closed on him, something made Clod turn toward me and my column. I immediately knelt and retied my shoe, pretending not to notice him noticing me.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure he fell for that,&#x201d; a voice from farther around the column said.</p><p>At one time in my life an unknown and unexpected voice addressing me out of the blue might have startled me. Not anymore. Now I practically yawned to show how blasï¿½ I was about such surprises. I also flicked an inconsequential speck of dust from the toe of my shoe to show I wasn&#x2019;t worried about whether or not Clod fell for my pretense. Then I stood up to see who&#x2019;d spoken. That I <i>could</i> see a living, breathing human standing there was a plus, even if I hadn&#x2019;t ever seen him before and had no idea who he was. Judging by the light gray overtaking the dark gray in his beard, I guessed he was in his fifties&#x2014;older than Clod by at least ten years and Joe by more than a dozen.</p><p>&#x201c;That was one of the Dunbar brothers, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t they named after composers?&#x201d; The camera around the stranger&#x2019;s neck made him look like a tourist. The soft twang in his question sounded local.</p><p>&#x201c;Poets. That was Coleridge,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;And the other one&#x2019;s name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He tried to tease it from his memory by tipping his head and waving his hand by his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Tennyson,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coleridge Blake Dunbar and Tennyson Yeats Dunbar,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;except the deputy there goes by Cole and his brother is Joe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Smart move.&#x201d; The stranger nodded. &#x201c;Better than Cold Fridge and Tennis Shoe, both of which I remember hearing when the boys would have been at a tender age. Huh. I haven&#x2019;t thought about them in years. But even back then I wondered how they&#x2019;d turn out, weighed down with those names.&#x201d; His tone was mild rather than judgmental. It had a reminiscent, storytelling sound to it.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re from Blue Plum?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for a few years, anyway,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Not for a few decades, if he hadn&#x2019;t known Clod was a sheriff&#x2019;s deputy and that Joe was, well, Joe.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I give you a hand with your string there?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d let go of the string when I pretended to tie my shoe. The end was still stuck to the column with the painter&#x2019;s tape.</p><p>&#x201c;Measuring it for a school project, right? You hold it there and I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d; He picked up the dangling end and walked around the column to meet me. &#x201c;One of my proudest moments in the fourth grade was when I made my cardboard model of the courthouse. Of course, a flexible metal tape measure would be the best way to do this, but your string works, too.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a felt-tip pen out of my shoulder bag and marked the string. He pulled the tape off the column, coiled the string, and handed it to me. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, tucking the string and pen back in my bag. &#x201c;It was nice of you to help.&#x201d; I turned to go.</p><p>And I saw Clod. He&#x2019;d come back out of the courthouse and stood beside the door in his police-issue posture, arms crossed, watching me and whoever the guy was who&#x2019;d just helped me with my string-and-column project.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Cole,&#x201d; I called, with a wave as wide and insincere as my smile. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s an old friend of yours.&#x201d; I pointed over my shoulder, then turned back to my new friend to reintroduce him to his old acquaintance. But no one was there.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Clod started to say something&#x2014;possibly <i>Good morning, Ms. Rutledge. Why are you lurking?</i>&#x2014;but the radio at his shoulder burped static. He listened and responded with a curt, clear &#x201c;Ten-four&#x201d; that I imagined spitting out the other end in another eruption of static, intelligible only to the starched and initiated. Without a wave or a nod, he put on his sunglasses and went down the steps and around the corner to where he parked behind the courthouse. I looked around again for the helpful stranger, didn&#x2019;t see him, and headed for the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat.</p><p>When I&#x2019;d decided to stay in Blue Plum (due to one thing or another&#x2014;one thing being the loss of my job as a textile conservator at the Illinois State Museum and the other being the lucky inheritance of Granny&#x2019;s house and business), Ardis Buchanan told me her secret for getting anywhere fast in our small town. No matter how short the distance, she got in her car and drove. <i>If I walk,</i> she&#x2019;d said,<i> I&#x2019;ll run into someone I know, and you and I both know that I am incapable of walking past the opportunity for a good chin-wag. </i>Ardis, longtime manager of the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat, wise in the ways and means of Blue Plum, was always worth listening to. I&#x2019;d adapted her solution for bypassing unavoidable chin-wags, taking it in a more ecological and heart-healthy direction. I walked, but I took the less traveled driveways that threaded between some of the businesses on Main Street and the service alleys running behind them.</p><p>The electronic chime on the back door of the Weaver&#x2019;s Cat was another reason I liked taking the alley way to work. The chime&#x2014;courtesy of my creative friend Joe, nï¿½ Tennyson, brother of the lamentable Clod&#x2014;said &#x201c;Baaaa&#x201d; every time the door opened. I loved it. Argyle, the cat in residence, liked the chime, too, and he came to greet me in the kitchen, his tail up like a signal flag that read <i>feed</i> <i>me</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t Ardis already given you breakfast this morning, sweet pea?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Argyle twined his yellow-striped body between my ankles. I stepped over him, he followed and twined, I stepped, he twined. Together, we moved toward the cupboard that held the dry cat food, doing what I&#x2019;d come to think of as the &#x201c;Paw de Deux.&#x201d; I tipped a few kibbles in his dish, and he thanked me with one last circuit of my ankles.</p><p>&#x201c;She never gives him enough,&#x201d; a voice grumped from somewhere near the ceiling. I looked up and saw Geneva, the ghost in residence, do a fade-in on top of the refrigerator. &#x201c;In my experience, young gentlemen require and enjoy unbelievable amounts of what&#x2019;s good for them.&#x201d;</p><p>I sidestepped Argyle&#x2019;s thank-you maneuver and looked down the hall toward the front of the shop. Talking to Geneva had gotten somewhat easier in the past couple of months. When she and I had first met, I was the only one who saw or heard her, and communicating openly&#x2014;without looking or sounding crazy&#x2014;had presented problems. But now that I&#x2019;d found a way for Ardis to see and hear her, I only needed to be careful around everyone else in the world. I saw no one in the hall and went back to the refrigerator. Geneva sat with her knees drawn up so that she looked like a wispy gray lump.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a young cat, Geneva. The vet says he might be as old as fifteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When you are one hundred and fifty-nine years old, then you come back and tell me if you still think fifteen isn&#x2019;t young.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But for a cat, especially one who had a rough early life, fifteen <i>is</i> old. The shop is Argyle&#x2019;s retirement home, and we need to take good care of him.&#x201d;</p><p>She pulled her knees closer and rested her chin on them, a pose that said &#x201c;hmph&#x201d; as clearly as words.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything going on this morning?&#x201d; I asked, watching her body language for further clues about her attitude in general and the current state of affairs between her and Ardis in particular. Watching her &#x201c;mist&#x201d; would be more accurate. She rarely appeared more substantial than a film of rainwater on a dark window, or more solid than an Orenburg lace shawl&#x2014;garments made of lace so fine they can be gathered and passed through the hole in a wedding ring. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Ardis this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmph.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Give her time, Geneva.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Plotinus: Volume IV, Enneads IV (Loeb Classical Library No. 443)</h2><p><p>Plotinus (204/5-270 CE) was the first and greatest of Neoplatonic philosophers. His writings were edited by his disciple Porphyry, who published them many years after his master's death in six sets of nine treatises each (the Enneads).</p><p>Plotinus regarded Plato as his master, and his own philosophy is a profoundly original development of the Platonism of the first two centuries of the Christian era and the closely related thought of the Neopythagoreans, with some influences from Aristotle and his followers and the Stoics, whose writings he knew well but used critically. He is a unique combination of mystic and Hellenic rationalist. His thought dominated later Greek philosophy and influenced both Christians and Moslems, and is still alive today because of its union of rationality and intense religious experience.</p><p>In his acclaimed edition of Plotinus, Armstrong provides excellent introductions to each treatise.

Reflecting the model eras of Chinese antiquity, the Analects offers valuable insights into successful governance and the ideal organization of society. Filled with humor and sarcasm, it reads like a casual conversation between teacher and student, emphasizing the role of the individual in the attainment of knowledge and the value of using historical events and people to illuminate moral and political concepts. <br><br>Confucius's teachings focus on cultural and peaceful pursuits and the characteristics of benevolent and culturally distinguished government. He also discusses ancestor worship and other rites performed for the spirits of the dead. The single most influential philosophical work in all of Chinese history, <i>The Analects of Confucius</i> has shaped the thought and customs of China and neighboring countries for centuries. Burton Watson's concise translation uses the pinyin romanization system and keeps explanatory notes to a minimum, yet his intimate knowledge of the Confucian tradition and precise attention to linguistic detail capture the original text's elegance, cogency, and wit.</p><p>Burton Watson has taught at Columbia, Stanford, and Kyoto Universities and is one of the world's best-known translators of Chinese and Japanese works. His translations include <i>The Tales of the Heike</i>; <i>The Lotus Sutra</i>; the writings of Zhuangzi, Mozi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi; <i>The Columbia Book of Chinese Poetry</i>; and <i>Records of the Grand Historian</i>.[Watson's] translation... is not only perhaps the most faithful to the writer's intentions, but also one of the few readable ones.

In the midst of overflowing bins of sumptuous yarn, unexpected winter romance now buzzes, in chorus with the spindles of shy new spinning instructor Lucy Adair. But when a rancher is found dead in Bellevue Canyon, avid knitter and sometime-sleuth Kelly Flynn quickly puts these festive pastimes aside. <br> &nbsp;<br> With his reputation for lovin&#x2019; and leavin&#x2019; the ladies of Fort Connor, it seems a little strange that the victim&#x2019;s final admirer was a fiancï¿½e...none other than the hopelessly bereaved Lucy Adair. Unluckily, Kelly also finds herself linked to the prime suspect in the case&#x2014;a rejected ex-lover of the playboy rancher. Charged with keeping both spinner and spurned from going over the edge, she&#x2019;ll discover more than a few secrets tangled on this triad&#x2019;s bobbin.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Delicious recipe and knitting pattern included!</b></p><p><b>Maggie Sefton</b>&nbsp;is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling Knitting Mysteries. She was born and raised in northern Virginia, where she received her bachelor&#x2019;s degree in English literature and journalism. While Sefton has worked as both a CPA and a real estate broker, she feels that neither of those endeavors compare to the challenge of creating worlds on paper. She is the mother of four grown daughters, currently scattered around the globe, and resides in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with two very demanding dogs.The third in the Knitting Mystery series once again features CPA and novice knitter Kelly Flynn, who sleuths around Fort Connor, Colorado, where she has found both a surrogate family and land on which to build her dream house. Sefton offers an acceptable mystery this time--finding out who killed a local double-dealing ladies' man--while twisting in plenty of details about knitting and spinning. Unfortunately, Sefton is guilty of a couple of extremely annoying literary tics: too many characters are introduced without enough description to keep them straight, and, worse, they do altogether too much grinning, smiling, and laughing (several times per page, in fact). Still, knitters will be pleased to add Sefton's series, now four installments strong, to their knitting-related fiction shelf (along with Kate Jacobs' chick-littish <i>Friday Night Knitting Club</i>, 2007). And, perhaps best of all, a nice pattern for a cable scarf ends the book. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Russell Kirk, whose life and thought has recently been featured in C-SPAN&#39;s acclaimed American Writers series -- intended this little book to be an assertion of the moral and social principles upholding our nation. Kirk&#39;s primer is an aid to reflection on those principles -- political, economic, and religious -- that have united Americans when faced with challenges and threats from the enemies of ordered freedom. In this new age of terrorism, Kirk&#39;s lucid and straightforward presentation of the articles of American belief is both necessary and welcome.

He and his younger sister, Katherine, had just traveled through time, from one foreign era to another. He was becoming an experienced time traveler&#x2014;a thirteen-year-old expert, you might even say. So he&#x2019;d learned that when he first landed in a new place and time, he just had to expect his brain to be a little fuzzy.<br> <br>And his eyes.<br> <br>And his ears.<br> <br>And ... Really, for all Jonah could tell, he and Katherine might be seconds away from being burned at the stake or tortured on a rack or trampled by stampeding horses fleeing a war. And he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see or hear or notice any of those things until it was too late.<br> <br>Anything was possible now.<br> <br><i>No, no,</i> Jonah told himself. <i>It&#x2019;s</i> history. <i>Everyone knows how it&#x2019;s supposed to go. JB wouldn&#x2019;t have sent us here if we were going to be in danger. Not right away, at least.</i><br> <br>JB was the true time-travel expert. It had taken a while, but Jonah trusted JB. The problem was, Jonah didn&#x2019;t have a very high opinion of the past. Twice now he and Katherine had gone back in time with other kids. They&#x2019;d been sent to fix history and save endangered children. Each time, their mission had gotten a little complicated ... and endangered <i>them.</i><br> <br>Jonah could have drowned.<br> <br>Katherine could have died in battle.<br> <br>Their friends could have been murdered.<br> <br><i>Near misses,</i> Jonah thought. Those two words, together, had more meaning than Jonah could bear to think about at the moment.<br> <br><i>And what&#x2019;s supposed to happen</i> now? Jonah wondered. <i>I don&#x2019;t know anything about what happened in ... 1611.</i> He was proud that he could remember the year they&#x2019;d been sent to. But the pride was followed by a shiver. <i>What if this is the year that fate catches up with us?</i><br> <br>That word&#x2014;<i>fate</i>&#x2014;prickled at his brain. It was too much for him to think about right now. He blinked and squinted, trying desperately to bring his vision into focus. A moment ago he&#x2019;d managed to read a paper held close to his eyes. But beyond that range everything was just a gray fog around him. The only thing he could hear was a muffled <i>thump-thump, thump-thump</i>, off in the distance. He could feel some cold, hard surface beneath him&#x2014;wood, maybe? <i>Wet</i> wood? Why would he be lying on wet boards?<br> <br>&#x201c;Jonah? Katherine?&#x201d; The voice spoke again, sounding so tinny and distorted that Jonah could barely understand. Jonah wasn&#x2019;t sure if the problem was his ears or the fact that the person was speaking to them from another time. &#x201c;We tried. We really tried....&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;JB?&#x201d; Jonah moaned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who else would it be?&#x201d; the voice said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe ... Second,&#x201d; Jonah&#x2019;s sister Katherine whimpered nearby. &#x201c;Second was talking to us on the way here....&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>Second</i> was talking to you again?&#x201d; JB asked, clearly alarmed. &#x201c;Oh, no....&#x201d;<br> <br>Once upon a time&#x2014;well, once upon a time in the distant future&#x2014;Second had been JB&#x2019;s most trusted employee. They&#x2019;d worked together restoring history to its proper course after unethical time travelers had messed it up.<br> <br>Then Second himself had decided to change the past.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d sabotaged Jonah and Katherine&#x2019;s trip to return their friend Andrea to the year 1600&#x2014;and to her original identity as Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America.<br> <br>Second had set up a reckless scheme to shift time from its intended path&#x2014;to improve it, he said. He&#x2019;d manipulated Andrea and Jonah and Katherine and their new friends Brendan and Antonio. He&#x2019;d risked their lives.<br> <br>And he&#x2019;d achieved everything he&#x2019;d wanted to in 1600.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d even managed to break down the barriers protecting time after 1600, so the results of his changes had rippled forward, changing everything along the way. Now all of time&#x2014;and history itself&#x2014;was in danger of collapsing, unless Jonah and Katherine could keep 1611 stable.<br> <br><i>No pressure,</i> Jonah told himself. <i>Nothing to worry about.</i><br> <br>It was too overwhelming to think about saving all of time, all of history, all of humanity from the year 1611 on. Jonah focused his thoughts a little more narrowly, on just one person:<br> <br>Andrea.<br> <br><i>Second promised,</i> Jonah thought. <i>He promised if we fix 1611, we can rescue Andrea....</i><br> <br>Actually, it was a package deal. Second had promised that Jonah and Katherine could rescue Brendan and Antonio and JB as well. <i>All</i> of them were stuck in the past. And, sure, Jonah wanted each of his friends to be safe. But it was Andrea he thought about the most: Andrea with her soft gray eyes, her gleaming brown hair, her stubborn hope that ...<br> <br>Katherine slugged Jonah in the arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop daydreaming about Andrea,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time for that.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Sheesh, how did she know?</i> Jonah wondered. He stopped himself from looking again at the drawing of Andrea on the paper he was holding in his hand. The drawing was torn from a book that had dropped on him only moments after they&#x2019;d arrived in 1611, and it proved that Second&#x2019;s changes had arrived too. But it also proved that somewhere back in time Andrea was still okay.<br> <br>Jonah realized Katherine was waiting for an answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t daydr&#x2014;,&#x201d; Jonah started to protest, but Katherine interrupted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you were,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking all lovesick and gloopy again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean, the way you look any time you&#x2019;re around Chip?&#x201d; Jonah taunted. He was trying to think of a better put-down, when something else struck him. He managed to raise himself slightly on trembling arms and turn his head toward his sister. &#x201c;You can see my face already?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting over the timesickness that fast?&#x201d;<br> <br>He squinted but could see Katherine only as splashes of color in the general fuzziness. Was that blur of yellow her hair? Pink, her T-shirt? Blue, her jeans?<br> <br>It seemed wrong, all those bright colors in the midst of the gray haze.<br> <br><i>We don&#x2019;t belong here,</i> Jonah thought, shivering. <i>Katherine doesn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t.</i><br> <br>Which would make fixing 1611 even harder.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;,&#x201d; Katherine began, but stopped, because JB was talking again.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see that we made even more mistakes than I thought,&#x201d; JB said.<br> <br>Now Jonah could tell where JB&#x2019;s voice was coming from: a small metal box that had fallen between him and Katherine. It looked like some antique meant for&#x2014;what? Jonah wondered. Holding a candle? Scooping flour?<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t matter. Jonah knew that the box was anything but antique, and that its appearance was completely fake. If it was transmitting JB&#x2019;s voice, it was actually an Elucidator, a device from the future that could camouflage itself to fit any time period. In Jonah&#x2019;s time&#x2014;the early twenty-first century&#x2014;it always looked like an ordinary cell phone.<br> <br>Having it look so primitive now probably meant that the technology in 1611 would be really, really lame. But Jonah was just glad to <i>have</i> an Elucidator. On their trip to 1600, Second had made sure they lost it. They&#x2019;d been entirely cut off.<br> <br>And exposed.<br> <br>Jonah managed to hold himself back from grabbing the Elucidator and clutching it like a little kid with a security blanket. But he did interrupt JB to ask, &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we set the Elucidator to make us invisible? Right away?&#x201d;<br> <br>Invisibility was one of the Elucidator&#x2019;s best apps.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um ... no,&#x201d; JB said nervously. &#x201c;Not just yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was odd. Usually JB was all about being cautious, not taking chances. Staying hidden.<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; JB said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have much time. We really messed up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We <i>know</i>,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;We saw what happened in 1600.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jonah shivered again, practically trembling. This was odd too&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t remember shivering as a symptom of timesickness before.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I mean,&#x201d; JB said. &#x201c;What we thought about time itself&#x2014;a lot of <i>that</i> was wrong. You have to understand&#x2014;time travel was so young then. We were as confused as all those early European explorers in their Age of Discovery. All their crazy notions ... Did you know they thought that in the summertime the North Pole would be as hot as the equator, because of the constant sunshine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So then someone went there, saw the glaciers, and figured out they were wrong,&#x201d; Katherine said impatiently. &#x201c;Just like you guys went back in time, figured out what it was like, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; JB&#x2019;s voice was hard suddenly, almost angry. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t find out that quickly. Time travel is not like geography. There are so many complications. So many extra variables. Things that don&#x2019;t show up until you&#x2019;ve made mistake upon mistake upon mistake.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jonah realized that his vision was clearing. He could see past the Elucidator now, past Katherine. Beyond her a thin layer of ice shone dully on a weathered wood floor and a cluster of equally weathered-looking barrels. And beyond that&#x2014;Jonah squinted&#x2014;was fog.<br> <br><i>So I still can&#x2019;t see everything,</i> he thought. He snorted, because the salt water in the air was stinging his nostrils. <i>No, wait&#x2014;that&#x2019;s</i> real <i>fog! That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t see anything!</i><br> <br>He sat all the way up, swaying only slightly. Now he could see the spot where the wooden floor met a wooden wall of sorts. But the wall rose up only about three or four feet. After that&#x2014;Jonah looked toward the gray, foggy sky&#x2014;there was an intricate arrangement of ropes leading up to billows of dingy, tattered white cloth.<br> <br><i>Sails,</i> Jonah thought. <i>Rigging. We&#x2019;re on a ship.</i><br> <br>The ropes also had a sheen of iciness. Icicles hung from the side of the ship.<br> <br>Jonah finally understood why he couldn&#x2019;t stop shivering: He was wearing only jeans and a T-shirt, and it was absolutely freezing here. The world around them seemed like the kind of place that never thawed.<br> <br>He gasped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sending <i>us</i> to the North Pole?&#x201d; he asked.</p><h2>Outliers: The Story of Success</h2><p><b>Learn what sets high achievers apart--from Bill Gates to the Beatles--in this #1 bestseller from "a singular talent" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).</b><br> <br>In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?<br>His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.<br><br>Brilliant and entertaining, <i>Outliers</i> is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, November 2008</b>: Now that he's gotten us talking about the viral life of ideas and the power of gut reactions, Malcolm Gladwell poses a more provocative question in <em>Outliers</em>: why do some people succeed, living remarkably productive and impactful lives, while so many more never reach their potential? Challenging our cherished belief of the "self-made man," he makes the democratic assertion that superstars don't arise out of nowhere, propelled by genius and talent: "they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot." Examining the lives of outliers from Mozart to Bill Gates, he builds a convincing case for how successful people rise on a tide of advantages, "some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky."<br><br> <em>Outliers</em> can be enjoyed for its bits of trivia, like why most pro hockey players were born in January, how many hours of practice it takes to master a skill, why the descendents of Jewish immigrant garment workers became the most powerful lawyers in New York, how a pilots' culture impacts their crash record, how a centuries-old culture of rice farming helps Asian kids master math. But there's more to it than that. Throughout all of these examples--and in more that delve into the social benefits of lighter skin color, and the reasons for school achievement gaps--Gladwell invites conversations about the complex ways privilege manifests in our culture. He leaves us pondering the gifts of our own history, and how the world could benefit if more of our kids were granted the opportunities to fulfill their remarkable potential. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><br><br>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>The Tipping Point,</i> <i>Blink, Outliers,</i> <i>What the Dog Saw,</i> and <i>David and Goliath.</i> He is also the co-founder of Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that produces the podcasts <i>Revisionist History</i>, which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood, and <i>Broken Record, </i>where he, Rick Rubin, and Bruce Headlam interview musicians across a wide range of genres.

When do you let go? <br>Born in Idaho's Bitterroot Mountains and raised in Spokane, Washington, Heacox moves to Alaska as a young park ranger and discovers a land and sea newly reborn from beneath a retreating glacier. &#x201c;People are reborn here too,&#x201d; he writes. &#x201c;This place is that powerful. In Glacier Bay you don't inherit, you create. You practice resurrection because the land and sea show you that anything is possible. Moose swim across fiords. Bears traverse glaciers. Flowers emerge from granite boulders. Inlets fill with glacial silt.

The victim, Yin Lige, a novelist known for her banned book, has been found dead in her tiny, humble room off the stairwell of a converted multi-family house. It seems that only a neighbor could have committed the crime, for the building is kept locked at night. But there is no apparent motive. Sergeant Yu tries to unravel the reclusive woman&#x2019;s past and begins to realize it may have larger political implications. The Cultural Revolution might be more than 30 years in the past, but its effects can still be felt at every level of Chinese society.</p><p>Qiu Xiaolong has been published in more than twenty languages, and more than one million copies of his mysteries, poetry, and literary criticism are in print around the world. He is the author of eight other Inspector Chen Cao mysteries, including <i>A Loyal Character Dancer</i> and <i>Death of a Red Heroine</i>. He lives in St. Louis with his wife and daughter.*Starred Review* The third Inspector Chen mystery--the second, <i>Death of a Red Heroine</i> (2000), won the Anthony Award)--is set in today's Shanghai, a city of 13 million people and an uneasy mixture of political and cultural movements, new and refusing to die. What better way to navigate this city than through the adventures of the detectives who handle homicides and disappearances for the Special Case Squad, the unit that deals with politically sensitive crimes? Inspector Chen, a former English major, poetry lover, and dedicated gourmand, briefly steps aside here (he has a translation project taking up his vacation time) and lets his subordinate, the housing-oppressed Detective Yu, handle the murder of a dissident writer, the female author of a novel considered highly critical of the new China. This woman, who lived in a traditional Shanghai <i>shikumen </i>house, had become a social isolate in that most social of buildings. In a somewhat heavy-handed contrivance, Chen's translation project involves a proposal for a modern galleria based on the communal <i>shikumen </i>model, drawing him inevitably back into the investigation. The Chen mysteries proceed at a stately, slow pace, not unlike the meals that Chen enjoys. Plot is secondary to food, to poetry, to politics, and to Chen's highly complex character. For those with similar taste and metabolism, these are mysteries to savor. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

He served as the president of the Mystery Writers of America and was awarded their Grand Master Award as well as the Mystery Writers of Great Britain's Gold Dagger Award.&nbsp; He died in 1983.CHAPTER 1 &nbsp; <br><br>I met the boy on the morning of the kidnapping. It was a Bright and blowing day. The wind was fresh from the sea, and the piled white cubes of the city sparkled under a swept blue sky. I had to force myself to go to work. &nbsp; <br><br>A bronze-painted sports car with a long foreign nose was standing at the curb in front of the County Annex building. I parked in my regular space, a few yards behind it. So far as I knew, there was only one bronze Jaguar in town. It belonged to Abel Johnson. I wasn't surprised when Fred Miner, Johnson&#x2019;s driver, emerged from my second-floor office and started down the outside steps to the street. &nbsp; <br><br>Fred reached the sidewalk and turned in my direction, a stocky man in his middle thirties who walked with a peculiar stiff-backed roll. The faded Navy suntans he always wore had darker patches on the sleeve, where his Chief's stripes and hash-mark had been removed. His only concession to his civilian occupation was a black, peaked chauffeur's cap, which shadowed his eyes. He passed my car without seeing me, his face closed in thought. &nbsp; <br><br>There was a yelp and a Hurry of movement from the sports car. A small boy with a head of bright red hair scrambled over the door and launched himself like a missile at Fred's legs. The man&#x2019;s face opened in a laugh of pure delight. Taking the boy under the arms, he swung him upside down in the air and set him back on his feet: &nbsp; <br><br>"Knock it off now, swabbie. This is no time for games. Come to attention." &nbsp; <br><br>"Okay, Fred," the boy chirped. &#x201c;Aye, aye, sir, I mean." He brought his feet together and arched his back. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Now wipe that smile off your face or I'll break you down to apprentice seaman and take away your privileges for fifteen years." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, sir." &nbsp; <br><br>The boy giggled. Fred tried to repress a snort of mirth, and couldn't. They stood on the sidewalk laughing into each other's faces. Passers-by smiled at them. &nbsp; <br><br>I stepped out of my car. When Fred saw me his face changed. &#x201c;Moming, Mr. Cross," he said without enthusiasm. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Fred. Looking for me?" &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I came in to see Mr. Linebarge." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;He's on his vacation." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, the little lady told me. I was up to your office already." &nbsp; <br><br>"I thought you didn't have to report until next week." &nbsp; <br><br>'lt wasn't that. I didn't come in to report. It was just a couple of questions I wanted to take up with Mr. Linebarge." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;About your probation?" &nbsp; <br><br>He looked sheepish, and shifted his weight from one leg to the other and back again. Being on probation embarrassed Fred. &#x201c;More or less. It wasn't anything important." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Can I help?" &nbsp; <br><br>He backed away a step. "No, I wouldn't want to bother you, Mr. Cross. I'll be seeing Mr. Linebarge next Saturday, anyway. He'll be back next Saturday, won't he?" &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;He will if he doesn't drown. He's gone on a fishing-trip." &nbsp; <br><br>The boy reached up and tugged at Fred's belt. &#x201c;ls something the matter? Can't we go on our trip?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Sure we can, Jamie." He brushed the cropped red head with his hand. "Remember now, no talking in the ranks." &nbsp; <br><br>"Is this the Johnson boy?" I said. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Yessir, this is Jamie Johnson. Jamie, meet Mr. Cross." He added with a trace of irony: "Mr. Cross is a very good friend of mine." &nbsp; <br><br>The boy gave me a sticky hand. &#x201c;Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cross. Any friend of Fred's is a friend of mine." <br><br>Fred's face lit up, but he said in a quarterdeck voice: &#x201c;You hustle back aboard now, before you talk yourself to death." &nbsp; <br><br>The boy scampered back to the Jaguar and dove head first over the low door. The last I saw of him was a thin denim behind and a pair of kicking moccasins. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;He's a bright youngster," I said. "How old is he?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Watch it, he'll hear you." Fred crossed his lips with an oil-grained forefinger, and lowered his voice. &#x201c;He shouldn't hear himself praised too much, it might give him a swell head. It's going to be tough enough on him with all the dough in the family. Jamie's four." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;He's doing all right for four. Who taught him his manners?" <br><br>&#x201c;He'll get by. I make him toe the mark." Fred started to move away. &#x201c;Well, so long, Mr. Cross. Nice seeing you." &nbsp; <br><br>"Hold it a minute. What's up?" &nbsp; <br><br>"There's nothing up," he answered woodenly. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;The boy said you were going on a trip. You're not leaving the county?" <br><br>&#x201c;No, I'm not going anywhere." He was a long time answering. &nbsp; <br><br>I was almost sure he was lying. "You know the rules. You're not allowed to go out of the county without definite permission from our office." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I know it." He colored uncomfortably. "I'm just taking Jamie for a ride. Is that illegal?" &nbsp; <br><br>"You're not supposed to drive except in line of work." &nbsp; <br><br>"I got my orders. That makes it work, doesn't it?" He &nbsp;glanced nervously towards the sports car. &#x201c;I ought to be on &nbsp;my way now, Mr. Cross." &nbsp; <br><br>"Your way to where?" &nbsp; <br><br>His face had closed up completely again, into a mask of blank hostility. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not supposed to tell anybody that." &nbsp; <br><br>"Are you in some kind of trouble?" &nbsp; <br><br>"No sir, I'm not. I haven't been in any trouble since February and I don't intend to get into any trouble." He said it with conviction.&nbsp; <br><br>"I'll take your word for it, Fred. You're all right as long as you don't leave the county, obey the traffic laws, and stay on the wagon. You know what happens if you break those conditions." &nbsp; <br><br>From the courthouse tower across the street, a bell began to sound the three-quarter hour. We both looked up at the tower clock. It was a quarter to nine. &nbsp; <br><br>"I know what happens," he said. &#x201c;I've got to shove off now, Mr. Cross." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;What's the hurry?" &nbsp; <br><br>He didn't answer. The vibration of the bell still hung in the air above us like an echoing warning. He squinted up at the great iron-faced clock and shifted his feet impatiently. &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;That's a fast car," I said. &#x201c;What will it do?" &nbsp; <br><br>"A hundred and twenty, maybe. I never opened her up." &nbsp; <br><br>"Remember to hold it down to fifty-five." &nbsp; <br><br>"I'll remember. Can I go now?" &nbsp; <br><br>I watched him climb into the driver's seat of the Jaguar. It was a tight fit. Fred was thick in the chest and wide across the shoulders, and his back was stiff from being broken in the war. As he was maneuvering himself in under the low convertible top, I noticed the gun-shaped bulge in his hip pocket. &nbsp; <br><br>I wasn't sure it was a gun. I didn't know whether he had the legal right to carry one. Before I decided to stop him the bronze car leaped away from the curb and disappeared around the corner of the courthouse. The fading sound of its motor was like an ill wind. &nbsp; <br>Ann Devon looked up from her typewriter when I entered the outer office. She was one of my two assistant probation-officers, a mouse blonde with a recent degree in psychology and large untapped reserves of girlish fervor. Turned in her chair against the light from the window, she made a very pleasant silhouette. &nbsp; <br><br>"Good morning, Howie. There's something on your mind." &nbsp; <br><br>"Please don't be intuitive so early in the day. I find it wearing." &nbsp; <br><br>"You might as well tell me," she said. &#x201c;You always get those nasty vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows." &nbsp; <br><br>"Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea." &nbsp; <br><br>"What wasn't?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Burning witches." &nbsp; <br><br>"Come on now, Howie. Tell good gray Doctor Devon." She was twenty-four. &nbsp; <br><br>I sat on the corner of her desk. On the far corner she had set a bowl of multicolored sweet peas that contrasted prettily with the calcimined walls and scuffed office furniture. &nbsp; <br><br>"What was Fred Miner after, or wouldn't he tell you, either?" &nbsp; <br><br>"He wanted to see Alex. I told him Alex was away, and he seemed rather worried and disappointed." &nbsp; <br><br>"Did he say why?" &nbsp; <br><br>"He mumbled something obscure about wanting to go through channels, and do the right thing for every body." &nbsp; <br><br>"I think there's something up his sleeve," I said. "1 met him on the sidewalk just now, and he acted pretty evasive. I couldn't get him to open up." &nbsp; <br><br>"You won't be mad if I tell you something, Howie? I think he's afraid of you." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Of me?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Quite a few people are. When you put on that grim righteous look. I was scared myself for the first six months or so." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I don't see why." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;You have a terrible lot of power over these people." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;I don't misuse it if I can help it." The conversation was beginning to irritate me. &nbsp; <br><br>"I know you don't. I wonder if Fred Miner knows it, though. With his Navy experience, he must be aware of what official power can do to him if he makes the slightest slip. After all, he doesn't know you the way he does Alex. I told him you'd be in soon, but he wouldn't wait. Probably he came in to ask Alex's advice about some private problem."&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;"He didn't say anything about going away?" &nbsp; <br><br>"Not a word. I'm sure you don't have to be concerned about him. Alex told me he's adjusting wonderfully." Ann's blue eyes darkened with feeling. "Personally I think he's a sturdy character. If I killed a man with my car, I swear I'd never be able to drive again." &nbsp; <br><br>"You call it driving, what you do?" &nbsp; <br><br>"I'm serious. You mustn't make fun of me." &nbsp; <br><br>"You mustn't waste all your fine emotion on a hit-run driver and a married man to boot." &nbsp; <br><br>She colored slightly. "Don't be ridiculous. My feelings about our clients are quite impersonal. Anyway, he isn't a hit-run driver, morally speaking. Alex says he didn't know he'd run over anyone, so it wasn't his fault." &nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;When they've been drinking, it's always their fault. You can pin that in your hat. It's an axiom." &nbsp; <br><br>Her eyes widened. "Had he been drinking? Alex didn't tell me that." &nbsp; <br><br>"Alex doesn't talk about his cases any more than he has to. It's a good rule to follow." &nbsp; <br><br>She said with a flash of impudence: "You're very morallecturey this morning." But her curiosity overcame her pique. "How do you know Fred Miner was drinking that night?" &nbsp; <br><br>"I read the police report. They gave him an intoximeter test when they arrested him. He was heavily loaded, over two hundred milligrams." &nbsp; <br><br>"Poor man. I didn't realize he was that way. Perhaps we should run a Rorschach on him. Alcoholics always have deep-seated emotional problems&#x2014;" &nbsp; <br><br>"He isn't alcoholic. He simply got drunk, as a lot of people do, and killed a man. Don't waste your sympathy on him, because he's been lucky. His wife stayed with him. His boss stood by him. If it wasn't for that, and his war record, Miner would be in jail." &nbsp; <br><br>"Well, I'm glad he isn't." She added irrationally: "Even if you're not." &nbsp; <br><br>She lowered her head and fired a machine-gun burst on the typewriter. Our conversations often ended like that. I liked to think that it was the ancient conflict between heart and head, with me representing head. &nbsp; <br><br>The courthouse clock had already struck nine, and I felt its delayed, guilty echo. Closing the door of the inner office rather sharply, I took off 'my jacket for work and spent the next two hours on the Dictaphone. I was doing a report on a prosperous matron who had been arrested for stealing several dresses from local shops. The dresses were invariably size nine. The lady was size eighteen, and had no children. &nbsp; <br><br>Between the paragraphs, my mind kept turning to Fred Miner. Though I wouldn't admit it to Ann, I felt a certain satisfaction in his case. Three months ago, in early February, it hadn't looked too promising. &nbsp; <br><br>According to the sheriff's office and the city police, Fred had got himself violently drunk on a Saturday night, had taken one of his employer's cars without permission, had run a man down in the road near Johnson's country house, and then driven on into town without stopping. The city police caught him steering in long sweeping arcs along the ocean boulevard, and booked him for drunken driving. The sheriff's men didn't find the body in the road until later that night, and then they were unable to identify the victim. &nbsp; <br><br>But one of the fog lamps was smashed on the Lincoln that Fred had been driving. Fragments of yellow glass from the fog lamp were scattered at the scene of the accident. One long shard of glass was found imbedded in the dead man's eye cavity. &nbsp; <br><br>The courthouse crowd predicted that Fred would be found guilty on a felony charge and sentenced to two to five years in state prison. Then Abel Johnson came back from his winter house in the desert. He found bail for Fred and put his personal lawyer on the case. The lawyer, a man named Seifel, pleaded him guilty to a reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter and applied for probation. &nbsp; <br><br>I assigned Alex Linebarge to do the report on Miner. Alex spent nearly a month going over his record with a fine-tooth comb. He came up with the conclusion that Fred Miner was a solid citizen who had made one grave mistake but wasn't very likely to make another. Fred was sentenced to one year in the county jail, suspended; he was fined three hundred dollars and put on five years' probation. &nbsp; <br><br>On the whole he had been lucky, as I said. His life had been salvaged, and my department had a stake in it. He'd fallen, been caught before he hit the bottom, and hoisted back to the moral tightrope that everyone has to walk every day. &nbsp; <br><br>But a man on probation walks his own high wire without a net. If he falls twice, he falls hard, into prison.</p><h2>BMW R nineT (2014 - 2018) Haynes Repair Manual (Haynes Powersport) Haynes Manuals</h2><p><p>"Each Haynes manual, whether in print or online format, is based on a complete disassembly and reassembly of the machine.

Evans adapted and then expanded in order to give his brilliant illustrator, Arthur Rackham, maximum opportunity to exercise his gifts. The product of their collaboration is one of the most wonderful editions we have of this, or any other, fairy tale.</p><p><b>Charles Seddon Evans (1883-1944)</b> was educated at East London College and began his career as a schoolmaster before joining the publishing house of Edward Arnold as Educational Editor in 1909. He moved to the firm of Heinemann in 1913, where he spent the rest of his working life, becoming Chairman and Managing Director in 1932. He wrote this version of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> as a companion volume to <i>Cinderella</i>, also illustrated by Arthur Rackham. The story first appeared in English in 1729, when Robert Samber translated Charles Perrault's fairy tale <i>La Belle au bois dormant</i>. C.S. Evans has expanded Perrault's story but followed the later version recorded by the Brothers Grimm in giving his heroine the name of Briar-Rose and ending with her awakening and betrothal, omitting the wicked mother-in-law who orders her grandchildren to be cooked for supper. Instead he lengthens the story by such inventive details as the menu for the christening feast, the books of magic consulted for an antidote to the thirteenth fairy's malice, and the many accomplishments of Princess Briar-Rose.</p><h2>Reap the Whirlwind: The Battle of the Rosebud, June 1876 (The Plainsmen)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This account of battle on the plains brings the period to life.&#x201d;&#x2014;</b><i><b>Publishers Weekly</b><br></i><br>Spring, 1876.

The Moon of Terrible Cold. On its heels the Moon of Hard Times. So for now the surrounding hills no longer lay beneath a blanket of white. Warmed by the sun, kissed with the gentle rains of the season and nourished by a hard and long winter&#x2019;s runoff, this great hunting land of his Hunkpatila was blooming once more.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the high places just below the snowcapped peaks the Mother&#x2019;s breast lay thick with tiny flowers of a hundred hues. Buds unfurled into a leafy green to drape every tree along the creeks and rivers with a rustling warmth that foretold of summer&#x2019;s coming. The gently rolling, virgin slopes lay smothered in the fragrant blossoms of buffalo pea and sego lily, dragonhead and purple fleabane. It was truly a time of spiritual renewal for his people.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Crazy Horse knew the soldiers would return. It was only a matter of time.<br> &nbsp;<br> So for now the people traveled once more accompanied by the rhythmic circle of the seasons just as the Lakota had for generations without number. And for the present, Crazy Horse reminded the young warriors to keep their weapons in readiness. In these warming days they could watch their ponies grow sleek and fat on the new grass that stretched across the hills clear to the spring sky as far as the eye could see, then farther still.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Hunkpatila had only to wait, Crazy Horse told them. The wasichu would be back.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps not this moon. More likely come Wipazuka Waste Wi, the Moon of Ripening Berries.<br> &nbsp;<br> If Crazy Horse understood anything about the pony soldiers, it was that he shared in common one undeniable trait with the white warrior chiefs: neither they, nor he, would give up as long as there was strength left in muscle, a drop of blood left unspilled in this last great struggle between their peoples.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those soldiers who had charged into the sleepy, unsuspecting Shahiyena camp of Two Moon would return one day soon. And as sure as he was of anything, Crazy Horse knew his people would be ready when that day dawned on this land of the Tongue and Rosebud and Greasy Grass. This time the Shahiyena and seven fires of the Lakota nation would be ready for the wasichu.<br> &nbsp;<br> This time there would be no running. This time the warriors would do more than merely cover the retreat of their villages.<br> &nbsp;<br> This time&#x2014;Crazy Horse swore before the grand council fires&#x2014;this time the red horsemen of the northern plains would exact a great reckoning, for once and for all days.<br> &nbsp;<br> This he knew, for Crazy Horse had long ago accepted that he had been chosen. He was a mystic.<br> &nbsp;<br> For three hard, hungry winters now, winters of empty bellies and snow blindness, winters of poor hunting and crying children, this slim warrior chief had experienced visions that presaged the coming summer&#x2019;s great battles. Dreams that reminded him that the days of glory were not over. Dreams of bloody clashes with the white man, instilling the Hunkpatila war chief with hope for this approaching time of glory and honor.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been a long, long and treacherous path coming to this spring moon.<br> &nbsp;<br> First the messengers had arrived from his old friend, Red Cloud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; the old Oglalla chief had asked the Hunkpatila people gathered around Crazy Horse last winter. &#x201c;Come in to the agency and let your people eat. The soldiers will be coming for those who do not.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At first he had just shaken his head, saddened that so great a war chief as Red Cloud, champion of the early days against the soldier forts, had now become an old woman cowed by his trips east to the land of the white man&#x2019;s Grandfather. Red Cloud was no longer a warrior chief to the Oglalla. Now instead, the once-great leader was a tired old man content to suck on his kukuse, the white man&#x2019;s pig meat, rather than feasting on buffalo and elk and the sweet antelope of these greening hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The snow is too deep,&#x201d; Crazy Horse had told the messengers. &#x201c;And our ponies are too poor with this long and terrible cold.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are others who are coming in,&#x201d; Red Cloud&#x2019;s messengers told the Hunkpatila. &#x201c;They are fighting the snow rather than fighting the soldiers. Despite the cold, they are pushing their ponies south.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Horse had nodded, staring at the dancing flames in that lodge, listening to the feral howling of the wind outside like some gaunt-bellied, lank-legged wolf prowling the outskirts of his village.<br> &nbsp;<br> And in the end Crazy Horse had told those messengers, &#x201c;It matters not to me that others choose to take that trail south back to the white man&#x2019;s agencies. As for the Hunkpatila, you tell Red Cloud&#x2014;my old friend of the days when we fought the Battle of the Hundred in the Hand,* the days when we attacked soldiers hiding behind the barricades near the Pine Fort&#x2020;&#x2014;tell my tired old friend that this is still my country. Tell him that no one&#x2014;not the white man, and not Red Cloud himself&#x2014;will ever tell the Hunkpatila where to go and how to live.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The soldiers will come. Red Cloud wished only to warn you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell Red Cloud I have been warned,&#x201d; Crazy Horse replied. &#x201c;The soldiers will know where to find me. I will not run this time. They will know where to find me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And the soldiers did come.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t that Crazy Horse had ever doubted Red Cloud&#x2019;s warning. Nor had he ever doubted that the white man&#x2019;s army would march north into this last great hunting ground of the Lakota and Shahiyena. It surprised him only when the soldiers attacked a small village of those who were struggling against the great cold and deep, icy snow to force their way back to the agency at White Rock. Shameful, that attack was. To charge into a village of those who were attempting to return so that their children and old ones would be warmed by the soldiers&#x2019; thin gray blankets, so that the sick ones would have some of the moldy flour and the white man&#x2019;s pig meat to put in their hungry bellies.<br> &nbsp;<br> It still hurt Crazy Horse to think back on that parting from his old friend He Dog, who was taking his family and eleven lodges south to join Two Moon and Old Bear on their trail back to the White Rock Agency. Like a tearing of flesh from flesh after all that tragedy had visited upon the lodge of Crazy Horse in recent winters: friends slaughtered in war against the many enemies of the Lakota; a brother killed in battle; a daughter cut down in her youth by a white man&#x2019;s disease that struck the weakest among them.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was such an evil thing, this white man&#x2019;s disease&#x2014;slashing at a man when he had no way to fight back. Such a season of blackness it was become, a season of despair.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even with his wife, Black Shawl, here with him ever since&#x2014;he had been so alone. So very alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then He Dog chose to leave.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crazy Horse vowed he would find a way to strike back, to avenge himself on the enemies that had visited so much grief upon his lodge.<br> &nbsp;<br> This he swore would be a summer of blood. He swore he would stand ankle deep in wasichu blood, cover himself with the gore and reek with the spoils of battle. This was to be the summer of his dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everything happened just as it had been foretold, exactly as he had seen it in his troubled sleep: winter&#x2019;s leaving on the heels of those messengers as the prairie became boggy with the melting snow. Then as suddenly as winter&#x2019;s cold breath had disappeared, it returned&#x2014;this time with a vengeance in the Moon of Snow Blindness, colder than all but the oldest of old men could remember it had ever been. But by then his Hunkpatila were safely camped on a creek near the Little Powder. All of his people, except the lodges moving south with He Dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the soldiers did not catch them on the trail to the reservation, the killing winter might easily claim them all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crazy Horse had worried. Not a quiet moment passed, not a day&#x2019;s short path of the sun across the sky, when the war chief did not brood on those eleven lodges pushing through the great cold and the deep snow toward the White Rock Agency.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then a runner from a village camped close to the soldier forts appeared among them, saying that the soldiers were claiming they had destroyed the camp of Crazy Horse. The warriors and women, the children and old men around that messenger had laughed at his declaration. But the Horse had not laughed. True, his camp had not been destroyed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet that meant the soldiers had exacted a savage blow on some village. Crazy Horse prayed there would be survivors.<br> &nbsp;<br> All too suddenly that cold, leaden afternoon as the gun-barrel gray clouds hung so low a man could almost reach out and touch them, they heard a shout from one of the sentries posted on the hills overlooking their camp along the Little Powder.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;People coming! People coming on foot from the south!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Young men and boys ran up the icy, crusty slopes among the snow-draped cedar and stunted pine to see for themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Crazy Horse did not need to look. He already knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Turning to the women of his camp, he had ordered them to stir life back into their sleeping fires, to dig out all extra food and clothing, blankets and robes, to bring forth their bags of roots and herbs they would need for the fingers and noses, ears and toes, bitten savagely by the cold, for the wounds caused by soldier bullets.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Seize the Fire (Star Trek: Typhon Pact #2)</h2><p>SEIZE THE FIRE <br><br>Shortly after revealing its union with the Federation&#x2019;s newest adversary&#x2014;a coalition of galactic powers known as the Typhon Pact&#x2014;the Gorn Hegemony suffers an ecological disaster that destroys the hatchery world of their critically important warrior caste.

TITAN</i>, DEEP IN THE VELA OB2 ASSOCIATION, BETA QUADRANT</b><p></p> <br>The aquamarine world that turned serenely on the main viewer had seemed hospitable enough when Captain William Riker had first looked upon it from orbit. It had seemed so when he had first set foot upon one of the small rocky continents that punctuated a planet-girdling, highly saline ocean. Other than the prevalence of strong winds, and the clouds of grit and dust they kicked up, the place had been very accommodating to <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s survey teams&#x2014;it offered breathable air, middling-warm temperatures, and fair-to-tolerable humidity levels.<br> <br>But the sometimes all-but-invisible fabric that nearly always accompanied such humanoid-compatible environments&#x2014;an oft-taken-for-granted little thing more commonly known as <i>life</i>&#x2014;was conspicuously absent from this place, from pole to pole and meridian to meridian.<br> <br>William Riker leaned forward in his command chair, resting his chin on his fist as he regarded the dead world that even now <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s planetary-science specialists were still busy trying to understand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Deanna, what do you think about naming this place &#x2018;Doornail&#x2019;?&#x201d; he said, turning to his left just far enough to see an amused smile split his wife&#x2019;s face.<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Doornail,&#x2019;&#x201d; repeated Commander Deanna Troi, <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s senior diplomatic officer, chief counselor, social-sciences department head&#x2014;and beloved <i>Imzadi</i> of the captain. She pitched her voice low, as if to be audible only in Riker&#x2019;s immediate vicinity. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a curious choice, Will.&#x201d;<br> <br>He repaid Deanna&#x2019;s grin with interest. After spending the past six hours down on that sterile, rocky world, he was grateful to be back aboard <i>Titan</i> and in the warmth of her presence. &#x201c;&#x2018;Doornail,&#x2019;&#x201d; he said, matching her sotto voce delivery. &#x201c;As in &#x2018;dead as a.&#x2019; &#x201c;<br> <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I understand the idiom, Will. My father came from Earth, after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t seem to be falling in love with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s a fine choice,&#x201d; she said, though a slight wrinkling of her nose belied her endorsement. &#x201c;Besides, assigning names to new worlds is one of your prerogatives as captain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Commander Christine Vale, who was seated in the chair to Riker&#x2019;s immediate right, chimed in quietly, &#x201c;At least until the Federation Science Council settles on something a little more, um, dignified.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ouch, Commander,&#x201d; Riker said as he turned his command chair so that he faced Vale. &#x201c;Way to show loyalty to your captain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vale answered with mock solemnity. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be much of a first officer if I didn&#x2019;t point out the captain&#x2019;s mistakes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Touchï¿½. But as I recall, you were quite a bit more eager than I was to get away from that dustball.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just more vocal about it, Captain. After all, a healthy set of lungs and a lack of hesitancy to use same are the main keys to success in this job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So . . . an exec&#x2019;s job amounts to either arguing with the captain, or just bellowing the captain&#x2019;s orders to the crew at the top of her lungs?&#x201d;<br> <br>Vale smirked as she pushed several strands of her shoulder-length auburn hair from her eyes. &#x201c;I learned from the best, sir&#x2014;aboard two ships called <i>Enterprise</i>. That reminds me of another nice thing about the planet: good acoustics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker heard Deanna snicker behind him. &#x201c;It sounds to me as if you like the planet a lot better now that you&#x2019;re safely back aboard <i>Titan</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Places like that always look better in retrospect,&#x201d; Vale said, gesturing toward the bluish orb that hung in the viewscreen&#x2019;s center. &#x201c;Not to mention from nearly five hundred kilometers away. Besides, it could have been worse. At least there weren&#x2019;t any mosquitoes&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>With an almost Vulcan-like calm, Deanna said something that Riker belatedly recognized as &#x201c;Incoming!&#x201d; Simultaneously, Vale interrupted herself by letting out a yelp&#x2014;accompanied by a brief chorus from Lieutenant Sariel Rager at ops and Lieutenant Aili Lavena at the conn&#x2014;that startled the captain into turning toward the section of the bridge at which his exec&#x2019;s eyes had been directed: the main viewer.<br> <br>An apparition had suddenly appeared directly between the screen and the forward helm and ops consoles, where it rapidly took on solidity&#x2014;or at least the appearance of solidity. In the space of a few heartbeats, it had become recognizable as the high-fidelity holographic avatar of Lieutenant Commander Melora Pazlar, even as it continued to hover several centimeters above the deck directly in front of the wide central screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m ever gonna get used to that,&#x201d; Vale said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nor will I,&#x201d; said Lavena. The Pacifican flight controller shuddered as though something had gone wrong with her hydration suit&#x2019;s temperature controls. The suit made a barely audible sloshing sound in response to her brief startle reaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Commander,&#x201d; Pazlar said. &#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br> <br>The senior science officer entered a command into the padd she carried; in response, <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s holographic telepresence system gingerly shifted her toward an open space on the bridge&#x2019;s port side. Pazlar&#x2019;s willowy form was outfitted in an ordinary duty uniform rather than in one of the slightly bulkier contragravity suits she wore when venturing outside the comfortable variable-<i>g</i> environment of her stellar cartography lab or her living quarters. Being an Elaysian born, bred, and raised in the microgravity environment of the planet known as Gemworld, Pazlar&#x2019;s body was structurally incompatible with a Federation starship&#x2019;s standard one-<i>g</i> environment.<br> <br>Riker turned his chair toward Pazlar&#x2019;s floating image. &#x201c;Commander, I assume you&#x2019;re here because the department heads have reached a consensus about the origins of this planet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Captain,&#x201d; Pazlar said. &#x201c;At least insofar as our current knowledge can take us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are most of you still convinced that this planet&#x2019;s M-class environment didn&#x2019;t come about naturally?&#x201d; Deanna asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;As surprising as you might find this,&#x201d; Pazlar said, &#x201c;the answer is &#x2018;yes.&#x2019; &#x201c;<br> <br>Riker smiled. &#x201c;Huh. Maybe &#x2018;Doornail&#x2019; will stick after all.&#x201d; As dead as they were, even doornails did not spontaneously generate themselves.<br> <br>Pazlar&#x2019;s V-ridged forehead wrinkled in puzzlement. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never mind. As I recall, you were part of the &#x2018;this planet&#x2019;s environment is a natural product of planetary evolution&#x2019; camp.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was, Captain. At least at the beginning of our analysis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What changed your mind?&#x201d; Riker wanted to know.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, to give credit where credit is due, Captain, Eviku and Chamish were the first to notice the pattern&#x2014;a pattern that appears to have played out in several other star systems scattered throughout the Vela OB2 Association, and perhaps even much further into deep Beta Quadrant space.&#x201d;<br> <br>Commander Christine Vale, <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s executive officer, spoke up from the seat at Riker&#x2019;s right hand. &#x201c;If anybody aboard <i>Titan</i> was going to find that sort of pattern, it would be our resident xenobiology and ecology experts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Apparently,&#x201d; Pazlar said with a nod. &#x201c;Unfortunately, my expertise in those fields doesn&#x2019;t overlap all that much with that of the biospheric scientists. My specialties are cosmology and big-bore physics. Since we hadn&#x2019;t found a clear-cut footprint indicating intelligence the way we had with the Sentries, I still needed a little more convincing at the outset.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like you got what you needed,&#x201d; Vale said.<br> <br>The Elaysian nodded. &#x201c;Torvig and White-Blue crunched the numbers&#x2014;twice, I might add&#x2014;and the end results finally made a believer out of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>SecondGen White-Blue was the designation of the eight-limbed artificial intelligence that Riker had allowed to remain aboard <i>Titan</i> a few months back, following the starship&#x2019;s harrowing encounter with White-Blue&#x2019;s kind, the ancient AI civilization whose members referred to themselves as &#x201c;the Sentries.&#x201d; Although Riker couldn&#x2019;t deny that White-Blue had been invaluable in preventing <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s destruction, both at the hands of White-Blue&#x2019;s own kind and via the destructive energies of their extradimensional nemesis, the Null, he was also keenly aware of how much trouble the little AI had brought to his ship. The fact that White-Blue had violated the ship&#x2019;s security and privacy protocols on numerous occasions&#x2014;to say nothing of its having briefly &#x201c;uplifted&#x201d; <i>Titan</i>&#x2019;s main computer to full sentience&#x2014;left the captain still wary of any judgments White-Blue might care to render. That White-Blue&#x2019;s conclusions were supported by calculations run by Ensign Torvig Bu-Kar-Nguv&#x2014;a Choblik science specialist whose own sentience depended upon an extraordinary degree of integration between his natural biological form and his bionic components&#x2014;made Riker feel only slightly better.<br> <br>Riker&#x2019;s face felt flushed as he noticed Deanna regarding him curiously from her station at his immediate left. He stood, straightening his uniform tunic as he got to his feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me the gist of it, Commander. Why are you convinced that this planet couldn&#x2019;t have produced its atmosphere on its own the way billions of other planets across the galaxy have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The long and short of it is the balance of gases in this planet&#x2019;s atmosphere, Captain,&#x201d; Pazlar said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll note that the sensors have corroborated Lieutenant Chamish&#x2019;s early contention that the eighty-twenty nitrogen-oxygen mix we observe here could only have been produced by nonbiotic processes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we certain of that?&#x201d; Deanna asked. &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t this planet&#x2019;s atmosphere have been produced by a thriving biosphere that was wiped out by some catastrophe in the relatively recent past?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pazlar shook her head, her fine white hair following a heartbeat behind owing to her protective cocoon of micro-gravity. &#x201c;None of the scans we&#x2019;ve done so far have turned up any evidence that there&#x2019;s <i>ever</i> been any life on this planet, let alone life that was catastrophically wiped out after producing a Class-M atmosphere.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker was no scientist, but he had enough scientific training to know that all Class-M planets&#x2019; atmospheres were significantly out-of-equilibrium in comparison with those of lifeless worlds. Dead places tended to have atmospheres that were devoid of free molecular oxygen, a gas that tended to get bound up in planetary crusts as oxides, as had occurred billions of years ago on Mars. Lifeless worlds whose atmospheres were &#x201c;in equilibrium&#x201d; routinely became anaerobic carbon dioxide hells like Venus, deserts like Mars, or stillborn &#x201c;primordial soups&#x201d; like his ship&#x2019;s namesake, Saturn&#x2019;s moon Titan.<br> <br>Facing Pazlar, Riker said, &#x201c;Correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, but there are still only two known ways to create an M-class environment, broadly speaking. The action of organic photosynthesis or similar biospheric processes on a planet&#x2019;s surface over eons is one.&#x201d; He began ticking off his points on his fingers. &#x201c;And terraforming technology is the other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the basic shape of it, Captain,&#x201d; said Pazlar&#x2019;s image. &#x201c;We have the evidence presented by the composition of the atmosphere itself. Our survey scans have already determined to a high degree of certainty that no biosphere has ever existed on this world. Doctor Chamish, our senior ecologist, triple-checked the figures.&#x201d; Although Riker didn&#x2019;t know Chamish all that well, he understood that Chamish&#x2019;s people were generally gifted with the ability to communicate telepathically with lower animals, and that their homeworld, Kazar, was renowned for producing gifted ecologists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Vale said. &#x201c;I may have stumbled into this exploration business by way of law enforcement and security instead of through a lab, but even I can see a flaw in your methodology.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pazlar nodded. &#x201c;You mean that no matter how many numbers I might crunch, I still can&#x2019;t really prove to a fare-thee-well that there never really was any biota on the planet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Commander Tuvok said from his position behind the tactical console. &#x201c;I trust that I need not point out that proving a negative is a logical impossibility.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning her chair halfway toward Tuvok, the exec nodded in agreement. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t absence of evidence sometimes just that? Absence of evidence?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As opposed to evidence of absence,&#x201d; said the stellar cartographer. &#x201c;Point taken. But biospheres <i>always</i> leave a mark on the worlds that host them. Even small, tenuous biospheres will make their presence known if your instruments are good enough. And our instruments are <i>damned</i> good.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker considered the most tenuous native biosphere that existed in his own species&#x2019; backyard&#x2014;that of Mars. The Martian ecology, marginal though it was by the time humans had developed any capability of studying it to any significant extent, had made itself known only by dint of the traces of atmospheric methane it released and maintained at slightly-above-equilibrium levels. Absent the continued action of a relative handful of hardy subsurface extremophile native microbe colonies, that methane would have quickly been photodissociated into its component elements and then dispersed or absorbed. And before Mars had been scrutinized under a sufficiently sensitive lens, those molecular traces had been undetectable; Mars, with its whisper-thin, oxygen-free atmosphere, had appeared already to be in an equilibrium state consistent with an eternally dead, lifeless desert.<br> <br>&#x201c;But as good as our instruments are,&#x201d; Riker said, &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t there still be an ancient biological marker that nobody&#x2019;s been able to find yet&#x2014;something so old it&#x2019;s literally buried at the very bottom of the rock pile?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a sharp limit to how old a fossil biosphere like that could be, Captain, given the atmosphere we&#x2019;ve observed here. Class-M atmospheres are inherently out of equilibrium with the surrounding environment. Without biota to maintain them, they always deteriorate into something much less friendly&#x2014;especially after a few tens of millions of years go by.&#x201d;<br> <br>Deanna shrugged. &#x201c;Suppose this atmosphere is being created right now by life so alien that our sensors simply couldn&#x2019;t recognize it <i>as</i> life?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;According to Eviku, that&#x2019;s still just barely possible,&#x201d; said Pazlar. &#x201c;But it isn&#x2019;t likely. Life processes, even extremely exotic ones, must involve some sort of metabolism that takes advantage of natural energy gradients&#x2014;that is, materials moving from a high-energy state to a lower one. Predictable patterns of internal order being created in exchange for increased external entropy. But we simply haven&#x2019;t seen anything remotely resembling that here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Riker nodded toward the blue world on the screen. &#x201c;So nothing is maintaining this world&#x2019;s atmosphere. Or at least nothing we&#x2019;ve detected so far.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Pazlar said. &#x201c;In fact, Chamish and Bralik have both confirmed that the oxygen in the atmosphere is slowly combining with the surface through natural weathering processes, even as it&#x2019;s being broken down by exospheric solar ultraviolet radiation. Since no detectable process is acting to maintain the atmosphere, it will succumb given enough time. Most of the free oxygen will end up in the rocks, and much of the rest will ultimately bleed off into space.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In other words,&#x201d; Riker said, &#x201c;what looks nominally like another Earth now will someday deteriorate into another Mars.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Assuming that the atmosphere&#x2019;s rate of deterioration remains relatively consistent ...</p><h2>Nicky Epstein The Essential Edgings Collection: 500 of Her Favorite Original Borders</h2><p>In her inspired collections of knitted&nbsp;edgings, acclaimed knitwear designer Nicky Epstein offered creative solutions for embellishing knits.

Those art forms have been touched by the genius of African American culture and have helped this nation take its important and unique place in the<br> pantheon of world art.<br><i>Steppin' on the Blues</i> explores not only the meaning of dance in African American life but also the ways in which music, song, and dance are interrelated in African American culture. Dance as it has emanated from the black community is a pervasive, vital, and distinctive form of expression--its movements speak eloquently of African American values and aesthetics. Beyond that it has been, finally, one of the most important means of cultural survival.<br> Former dancer Jacqui Malone throws a fresh spotlight on the cultural<br> history of black dance, the Africanisms that have influenced it, and the<br> significant role that vocal harmony groups, black college and university<br> marching bands, and black sorority and fraternity stepping teams have<br> played in the evolution of dance in African American life. From the cakewalk to the development of jazz dance and jazz music, all Americans can take pride in the vitality, dynamism, drama, joy, and uncommon singularity with which African American dance has gifted the world.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>This book explores not only the meaning of dance in African American life but also the ways in which music, song, and dance are interrelated in African American culture.

Updating the model of the Moravians in Hernnhut, Germany two centuries ago, James Goll lays out a plan for today: an Internet-based community of intercessors who commit to pray one hour per week for (1) revival in the church, (2) youth awakening, (3) Israel, and (4) major crises. God does nothing but in answer to prayer, said John Wesley. This first book in the Prayer Storm series helps to raise up a new worldwide band of fervent intercessors.</p></p><p>Dr. James W. Goll is the co-founder of Encounters Network, Director of Prayer Storm and coordinates Encounters Alliance, a coalition of leaders. He has shared Jesus in over 40 nations worldwide.

Once he could have done this work without harm. Once his skin had been covered with comfortable calluses, protecting him from the slippery handle of the sickle, but no longer. For three years he&#x2019;d been freed of farmwork. He&#x2019;d spent his time memorizing poetry and plucking away at a harp&#x2014;not that he&#x2019;d ever equaled the Bard. Or ever would.<br> <br>Sweat ran down his forehead. Jack wiped his face and only succeeded in getting dirt into his eyes. &#x201c;Curse this job!&#x201d; he cried, hurling the sickle to the earth.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least you have two hands,&#x201d; said Thorgil, sweating and laboring nearby. She had to hold the bracken ferns in the crook of her arm and slice through them with her knife. Her right hand was frozen, useless, yet she didn&#x2019;t give up. It both impressed and annoyed Jack.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t someone else do this?&#x201d; he complained, sitting down in the springy bracken.<br> <br>&#x201c;Even Thor does inglorious chores when he&#x2019;s on a quest,&#x201d; said Thorgil, stolidly dumping an armload of bracken into a growing pile. She turned to gather more.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is no quest! This is thrall work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d know,&#x201d; retorted the shield maiden.<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s face turned even hotter as he remembered how he&#x2019;d been a slave in the Northland. But he swallowed the obvious response that Thorgil herself had been a thrall as a child. She was prey to dark moods that rippled out to blight everyone around her. That was the word for her, Jack thought grimly. She was a <i>blight,</i> a kind of disease that turned everything yellow.<br> <br>Nothing had worked out since she&#x2019;d arrived in the village. It took the utmost threats from the Bard to keep her from revealing that she was a Northman, one of the murdering pirates who&#x2019;d descended on the Holy Isle. Even as it was, the villagers were suspicious of her. She refused to wear women&#x2019;s clothes. She took offense readily. She was crude. She was sullen. In short, she was a perfect example of a Northman.<br> <br>And yet, Jack had to remind himself, she had their virtues too&#x2014;if you could call anything about Northmen virtuous. Thorgil was brave, loyal, and utterly trustworthy. If only she were more flexible!<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d shift your backside, I could harvest that bracken. Or were you planning on using it as a bed?&#x201d; Thorgil said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, shut up!&#x201d; Jack snatched up his sickle and winced as a blister broke on his hand.<br> <br>They worked silently for a long time. The sun sent shafts of heat into the airless woodland. The sky&#x2014;what they could see of it&#x2014;was a cloudless blue. It pressed down on them like an inverted lake&#x2014;hot, humid, and completely still. Jack found it hard to believe that a storm was on its way, but that&#x2019;s what the Bard had said. No one questioned the Bard. He listened to birds and observed the motions of the sea from his lonely perch near the old Roman house where he lived.<br> <br>A rumbling sound made both Jack and Thorgil look up. The blacksmith&#x2019;s two slaves had arrived with an oxcart. A moment later the large, silent men crashed through the underbrush to gather up the bracken. They tramped to and fro, never speaking, never making eye contact. They had been sold by their father in Bebba&#x2019;s Town because they were of limited intelligence, and Jack wondered what kind of thoughts they had. They never seemed to communicate with each other or anyone else.<br> <br>Even animals thought. As the Bard had instructed Jack, animals had much lore to impart to those who paid attention to them. What kind of lore did Gog and Magog, as the slaves were called, have to impart? Nothing good, Jack decided, looking at their brooding, averted faces.<br> <br>When the oxcart had been loaded, Jack and Thorgil set off for home. Most of the time they lived at the Bard&#x2019;s house, but now, during the crisis of the impending storm, they had returned to the farm Jack&#x2019;s parents owned. It had grown a great deal in the last three years.<br> <br>Beside the fields, farmhouse, barn, and winter storage shed was a new dairy Jack&#x2019;s father had built. This contained three sturdy black cows tended by Pega, whom Jack had freed from slavery. She also cared for the chickens, new lambs, and a donkey. But she was not allowed to touch the horses. The horses were Thorgil&#x2019;s domain and jealously guarded, particularly from the tanner&#x2019;s daughters.<br> <br>At the edge of the property, where the land was too stony for crops, was a hovel constructed of peat. This was where the tanner&#x2019;s widow and her two daughters crowded together with hardly more room than three peas in a pod. They had arrived to help Jack&#x2019;s mother the year before and had never gone home.<br> <br>&#x201c;I <i>wish</i> this storm would arrive,&#x201d; cried Thorgil, throwing a stone at a crow. The crow eluded it. &#x201c;The air&#x2019;s so heavy! It&#x2019;s like breathing under mud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack looked up at the cloudless, blue sky. Except for the ominous stillness, it could have been any early summer day. &#x201c;The Bard spoke to a swallow from the south. It told him that the currents in the air were disordered and all the migrating birds were confused. Why don&#x2019;t you ever talk to birds, Thorgil?&#x201d; The shield maiden had gained this ability when she&#x2019;d accidentally tasted dragon blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;They never tell me anything,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe if you didn&#x2019;t throw rocks at them ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Birds are stupid,&#x201d; Thorgil said with finality.<br> <br>Jack shrugged. It was like her to ignore the gifts she had and to demand what she could never achieve, a glorious career as a warrior. Her paralyzed hand had put an end to that. She also wanted to be a poet. Jack had to admit that she wasn&#x2019;t bad. Her voice was harsh and she had a fondness for bloody death scenes, but her stories held your attention.<br> <br>During long winter evenings the villagers gathered at the chief&#x2019;s hearth for song and hot cider. The Bard played his harp, and when he wearied, Jack and Thorgil recited sagas. Brother Aiden, the little monk from the Holy Isle, joined in with tales of the god Jesus, of how He fed a thousand people with five fishes and performed many other diverting miracles. But the real draw at these gatherings was Pega. Her voice was so compelling that the very storm blasts hushed to listen to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;By Thor, those Tanner brats are meddling with my horses!&#x201d; Thorgil broke into a run, and Jack hurried after to break up the inevitable fight. The tanner&#x2019;s daughters were fascinated by the horses, a gift from King Brutus the year before. Actually, it was unclear whose horses they were, since they&#x2019;d been handed to the entire group of pilgrims returning from Bebba&#x2019;s Town. Jack thought they ought to be the Bard&#x2019;s, but Thorgil insisted that they were hers by right, since she was the only true warrior among them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get off, you mangy curs! You&#x2019;ll ruin their training!&#x201d; Thorgil whistled and the horses wheeled, throwing their small riders into the dirt. The animals came to a halt before the shield maiden, prancing nervously like the spirited creatures they were. Jack ran to pick up the howling girls. &#x201c;Tell them to shut up or I&#x2019;ll really give them something to blubber about,&#x201d; snarled Thorgil, stroking the manes of the horses.<br> <br>Jack checked the girls and found they had no real injuries. They were eight and ten, stunted from years of bad food and the noxious air of the old tannery where they had lived until their father died. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re only children,&#x201d; Jack reproved, wiping the girls&#x2019; dirty, tear-streaked faces with the tail of his tunic. &#x201c;You probably did the same thing at that age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>I</i> was a shield maiden. I was the daughter of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Careful!&#x201d; Jack said sharply. The girls stopped crying and eyed Thorgil curiously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who was your da, then?&#x201d; the older one demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably a troll,&#x201d; the younger said, giggling. Thorgil reached down, but they sped off before she could wallop them with a rock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Filthy bog rats,&#x201d; Thorgil said.<br> <br>&#x201c;All it will take is one slip,&#x201d; Jack warned. &#x201c;One hint that you are not a Saxon to someone who has reason to hate you, and the whole village will turn against you. And it will turn against my parents and me for sheltering you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That debt is the only thing that keeps me from flinging my true heritage into their faces.&#x201d; Thorgil embraced the neck of one of the horses, and it blew a long, horsey kiss at her. Jack was impressed, as always, by how much the animals loved her. Too bad she couldn&#x2019;t inspire the same sentiment in people.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to the house,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving, and we have to cut bracken all afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Curse the bracken,&#x201d; swore Thorgil. &#x201c;Curse the pointless, boring existence in this village. For one rotten turnip I&#x2019;d throw myself off a cliff into the sea!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said Jack, leading the way.</p><h2>Crusade (2) (Starfire)</h2><p>In the period of peace following the Human-Orion War, a ship from a half-forgotten history emerges from a warp point notorious for devouring ships and opens fire on the Orions.

His critics argue he has been anything but, pointing to his conservative victories on voting rights and campaign finance. Yet he broke from orthodoxy in his decision to preserve Obamacare. How are we to understand the motives of the most powerful judge in the land? <br> In <i>The Chief</i>, award-winning journalist Joan Biskupic contends that Roberts is torn between two, often divergent, priorities: to carry out a conservative agenda, and to protect the Court's image and his place in history. Biskupic shows how Roberts's dual commitments have fostered distrust among his colleagues, with major consequences for the law. Trenchant and authoritative, The Chief reveals the making of a justice and the drama on this nation's highest court. <br></p><p><b>Joan Biskupic</b> is a legal analyst at CNN.

It is essential reading for anyone who truly wants to understand this pivotal moment in Supreme Court history."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Post </i></b></i></b><br><br>"Assiduously reported and briskly written...[Biskupic] suggests that [Roberts] is pulled by two often-conflicting instincts.

The other is institutional: an interest in the court being respected and seen as nonpolitical."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review </i></b></i></b><br><br>"An approachable volume about subjects often unapproachable.

The poems trace the story of Sanchez&#39;s brother: his alienation from his family, his struggle with HIV, and the family&#39;s eventual healing. Sanchez spins these lines in the voices of all the family members, as well as ancestors. The narrative takes on the elevated tone of Greek tragedy, or maybe the more solemn works of Wole Soyinka, and gives some sense of how overwhelming, painful, and powerful family bonds can be. June Jordan writes that this book joins Sanchez&#39;s &#34;best poetry to her deepest feelings.&#34;<b>Sonia Sanchez</b> is poet, activist, scholar, and formerly the Laura Carnell Professor of English and Women's Studies at Temple University, and is currently a poet-in-residence there.

He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U. Levon), <b>The Further Inquiry</b>, <b>Sailor Song</b>, and <b>Last Go Round</b> (with Ken Babbs). His two children's books are <b>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</b> and <b>The Sea Lion</b>. Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.The central theme running through this collection of stories (many of which seem to be primarily nonfiction with elements of fiction thrown in) by the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the struggle to come to terms with the legacy of the 1960s. Kesey draws largely on his own experiences after returning to his Oregon farm following a brief stint in prison on drug charges. A series of tales, apparently sections from a novel in progress, star an alter-ego named Devlin Deboree: his relatively tranquil post-jail farm existence is disturbed both by memories of now-dead companions and the seemingly extinct passions of the '60s, and by burned-out refugees from that era who intermittently arrive on his doorstep, hoping for some sort of help from the most famous survivor of the psychedelic wars. Pieces on visiting Egypt and covering a Chinese marathon examine the complex relationship between Americans and people from other cultures. Kesey's distinctive gift with language and tough sense of humor unify this somewhat disorganized collection, and his elegy for the passing of the mad energy of the '60s will strike a responsive chord with all those who lived through those dangerous, liberating years. 30,000 first printing; BOMC and QPBC alternates. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Fine Passion (Bastion Club, 4)</h2><p><p>The men of the Bastion Club are powerful, loyal, and not averse to overcoming danger if they must.

He is the author of <i>Metronome</i>.<i>First Century</i> <br> <br> <i>Citï¿½</i> <br>Caesar&#x2019;s Cradle <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you getting off at the next stop?&#x201d; This question was posed to me in a timid voice by a diminutive lady who had nudged me gently. <br>The subway car&#x2019;s brakes squealed loudly and metallically. <i>Get off here? Actually, yes, I will get off here.</i> ï¿½le de la Citï¿½ is the ideal place to start: this island sits at the very heart of Paris and is its birthplace; appropriately enough, it has the shape of a cradle. &#x201c;The head, the heart, the very marrow of Paris,&#x201d; as Gui de Bazoches wrote in the twelfth century. <br>The ï¿½le de la Citï¿½ stop consists of a series of wells dug deep into the city&#x2019;s entrails&#x2014;almost fifty feet (some twenty meters) below the water level of the Seine, and, as in Jules Verne&#x2019;s <i>Voyage to the Center of the Earth,</i> when you go down into it you have the feeling that time moves in reverse. No need of a volcano shaft to get down into the depths, or a <i>Nautilus</i> to dive leagues down below the surface. The Citï¿½ stop will do. <br>I vaulted up the metal circular stairs four at a time and headed toward the light, leaving the nice lady far behind. Once outside I ran smack into a scraggly cypress tree. I extricated myself only to find that now I was tangled up in the branches of an olive tree. <i>Aha!</i> I thought. <i>An olive tree! A trace of the South, a faint echo of the Italian countryside</i>. Actually, however, I was in the middle of the Citï¿½&#x2019;s flower market, which crowds right up to the edge of the subway entrance, as if both nature and history were trying to reclaim what once was rightfully theirs. Their success at this is illusory, for on one side the cars hum along in their endless descent down Boulevard Saint-Michel; on the other there is the same flood of cars heading in the other direction, climbing Rue Saint-Jacques. <br>After a few steps I reached the quays. A little farther along are the green boxes of the <i>bouquinistes</i>&#x2014;the vendors of secondhand books and old prints. I can never resist plunging in and always resurface with something, on this occasion two dog-eared histories of Paris. I sometimes think that the city is my wife. It is most definitely a woman, as Andrï¿½ Breton put it in <i>Nadja,</i> his Surrealist novel: the triangle formed by the Place Dauphine represents the delta of Venus from whose womb it all emerged. I wanted to go in, not out; I wanted to return to a time before cars and the gray faï¿½ades of the buildings, back to when the banks of the Seine were verdant slopes presiding over a muddy bog and the island was forested. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>It is the 701st year following the founding of Rome and fifty-two years before the birth of Jesus Christ. ï¿½le de la Citï¿½ is empty&#x2014;there are no houses, no structures, nothing. There&#x2019;s also as yet no sign of the Lutes of which Julius Caesar spoke in his <i>History of the Gauls</i>. &#x201c;Lutetia, town [ <i>oppidum</i>] of the Parisii, located on an island in the Seine.&#x201d; Not very precise, of course, and indeed the proconsul had spent all of one day in the place, a day on which he was far more preoccupied with the gathering of the Gaul chiefs than he was with exploring the boundaries of this <i>oppidum</i>. In fact, when he came to write his history, Caesar knew it only through secondhand sources, relying on rumors and on hastily written military reports. He repeated what he had heard bruited about by his legionaries, whose descriptions were very sketchy. <br>Here&#x2019;s the thing. Just where you might expect to find something there was&nbsp;&#x2026; nothing. The future ï¿½le de la Citï¿½&#x2014;the very heart of Paris&#x2014;consisted of six or seven little islands on which sat a small temple and several simple huts with reddish thatched roofs. It was no hive of activity. You might see a handful of fishermen casually casting their nets into the waters. On the Right Bank, stretching westward, were swamps and a dense forest. On the Left Bank, still more wetlands, and, farther along, a rocky promontory referred to as a &#x201c;mountain,&#x201d; which one day would be called &#x201c;Montagne Sainte-Geneviï¿½ve.&#x201d; <br>To find the significant-sized Gallic town the Roman legionaries referred to as the great city of the Parisii, you had to go downriver, to the west. At the time, the river offered the only way of getting around. Roads would come later and be built by the Romans. To get anywhere you were forced to clamber down the bank at one of the launch sites favored by the Gauls, climb into a long, delicate craft made of tree limbs, and venture out into the water. <br>The boat was the ancestral mode of transportation for the Parisii. Predictably, the earliest remnants of settlements here, dating back to the Neolithic period (five thousand years before Christ) were dugout canoes. They were discovered in Bercy, the little suburb that was the protocrib of Paris. Today these primitive boats can be found in the Musï¿½e Carnavalet, the museum that conserves the city&#x2019;s history. <br>To find the real Gallic Lutï¿½ce, which is what we French call Lutetia, you have to travel west down the Seine for twenty or so miles, to a spot where the river bends back upon itself so dramatically that it nearly forms a circle. Some Romans might understandably have confused it for an island. And in this enormous bend a city came to life, with streets and shops and neighborhoods and a port. Here was Lutï¿½ce, or, more exactly, in the Gallic tongue, <i>Lucotecia,</i> a name as fluid as its location. Caesar shortened <i>Lucotecia</i> to Lutetia, more closely approximating the Latin <i>lutum,</i> meaning &#x201c;mud,&#x201d; and the Gallic <i>luto,</i> meaning &#x201c;swamp.&#x201d; The city emerged from the swamp; name and place correlated perfectly. <br>Originally from the north, the tribe that settled on the banks of the river depended upon it. To the members of this tribe, the river was a goddess&#x2014;Sequana&#x2014;capable of curing disease, and she gave her name to the waters that ran along the length of Lutï¿½ce, the Seine. The river offered very tangible benefits to these people, for not only did it provide the fish that fed them and the water that helped them grow wheat, and which sustained the humans and animals, it served as their means of contact with the outside world. Their coins were among the most beautiful in all of Gaul, golden and bright, one side featuring Apollo and the other a horse in full gallop. Farther away, beyond the city, the fertile soil helped the Parisii&#x2014;who were farmers, herders, metalsmiths, and woodcutters&#x2014;prosper. <br>Where was the original Lutï¿½ce located? <br>Over the centuries, historians have repeatedly tried to claim that Lutï¿½ce was located on ï¿½le de la Citï¿½. There was but one small and vexing problem with that. No matter how deeply they dug, and dug, and dug, none could find even the smallest trace of the legendary Gallic city. <br>&#x201c;Big deal,&#x201d; said some among them. &#x201c;The Gauls built straw huts, and they simply disappeared during all the invasions and migrations.&#x201d; <br>It certainly is the case that the island was frequently destroyed, rebuilt, and redestroyed, and that all trace of the original has disappeared. And when you consider the last great urban transformation of Paris, undertaken by Baron Haussmann in the nineteenth century, during which older buildings were either razed or modified nearly beyond recognition, there would be no way of uncovering a single trace of its past. The only positively identified remains would be the ones you would find if you went to the Place Vert-Galant (referring to Henri IV of Navarre, whom we&#x2019;ll meet later). Dig down twenty or so feet and you would find yourself at the level where the Parisii once lived. That means that twenty feet of detritus have accumulated over two thousand years. <br>So it&#x2019;s completely disappeared? Well, not quite. To help with traffic flow, city engineers designed the A86, a so-called <i>super</i>- <i>pï¿½riphï¿½rique</i>. The idea was to create an even wider ring road around Paris. When they were digging at one of the construction sites in 2003, located beneath the city of Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris, workers came across the remains of what clearly had been a large and prosperous settlement. It had everything&#x2014;houses, streets, wells, a port, even some graves. <br>Archaeologists also identified a large field bordered by ditches and fences; in it they found a spit used for roasting and a caldron fork. This led them to think that it must have been set apart and used for community cookouts. Setting Lutï¿½ce in the fluvial bend of Gennevilliers&#x2014;which was far more visible then than it is today&#x2014;served two needs: the location meant that the river and Mont Valï¿½rien afforded them greater security; more importantly, it gave them two ways of accessing the water, which was the source of riches and the axis of exchange. <br>Painful though it might be for Parisians, they may have to accept the fact that the original Lutï¿½ce was located not in their city but in its suburbs. <br>The &#x201c;Kwarisii,&#x201d; the Celtic people of the quarries, became the Gallic &#x201c;Parisii&#x201d; sometime in the third century B.C. (The Celtic <i>k</i> was transformed into the Gallic <i>p</i>.) These people had done so much navigating in their boats before settling the area that later their origins would become mixed up with those of other peoples and other legends. To glorify their ancestors, and therefore themselves, the descendants of these rock breakers and humble fishermen would clothe their genealogical forebears in all kinds of bright costumes. The Parisii would become nothing less than the descendants of the Egyptian goddess Isis, or, better yet, the children of Paris, the prince of Troy and youngest son of King Priam. Paris, as we all know, had run off with Helen, the wife of Menelaus, leading to a terrible and protracted war between the Greeks and the Trojans. He escaped death at the hands of the jealous husband thanks to Aphrodite, who hid her protï¿½gï¿½ in the protective fog of the heavens and whisked him out of Troy. Troy, however, was not spared. Helen was reunited with Menelaus. Paris fled to the banks of the Seine, where he would give rise to a new people. <br>It was a pretty tale, if one with absolutely no basis in fact, but it gave to succeeding generations of Parisii a gloriously divine heritage of which to be proud. Much later, in the thirteenth century, Saint Louis strongly encouraged belief in this myth, which thrived during the entirety of the Capetian reign. &#x201c;Our civilization was not descended from a band of wandering Celts. We share a noble ancestry with the Romans.&#x201d; That was also what most of the Frankish kings had thought. <br>But we&#x2019;re getting way ahead of ourselves. For in the time in question the Romans had the upper hand in this part of the world, imposing their language and culture and appropriating myths and legends that justified their having conquered the world. Of course, the Romans were themselves merely descendants of some Indo-European tribe that had settled in what would become Italy in the seventh century B.C. They chose to believe otherwise. &#x201c;We are descended from gods and heroes,&#x201d; their leaders declaimed. <br>This line of reasoning in turn followed from Homer&#x2019;s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey,</i> which legitimated the supremacy of the Greeks in the Mediterranean. Then in the first century B.C., Virgil wrote the <i>Aeneid,</i> a tale that was a carbon copy of its illustrious Homeric predecessors, with the difference being that the heroes were now Roman rather than Greek. The Trojan Aeneas, a son of Aphrodite, fled Troy as it was being destroyed by the Greeks and founded Rome, taking with him his son Iulius, the ancestor of Caesar (&#x201c;Julius&#x201d; is the family name for anyone called &#x201c;Caesar,&#x201d; coming from &#x201c;Julia,&#x201d; as the Latin <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> are interchangeable). Caesar had the right to rule the world because he was descended from the gods. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>In this year, 52 B.C., the Romans arrived to attack the humble Parisii and to occupy their lands along the banks of the Seine. This people had had, well, the gall, to be among the first to resist. They rallied behind a certain Arvernian chief named Vercingetorix, who was determined to unite the Gallic tribes and together repel the Roman invaders. Julius Caesar, keen to bring order to the distant borders of the empire, sent in his best general, Titus Labienus. <br>Titus Labienus came with four legions and a cavalry regiment, sending the Lutetians into a panic. How were they going to defend themselves? They sent an urgent message to the town of Mediolanum Aulercorum&#x2014;today, Evreux&#x2014;where lived an elderly chief whom the entire Gallic world respectfully referred to as Camulogenus, which means &#x201c;son of Camulus,&#x201d; who was himself the son of the god of war. With a name like that, the man had no choice but to come and defend the city from the Romans. The citizens placed their fate in his hands. Camulogenus would organize the counterattack and push back the enemy. <br>What could the poor old man do? He was placed at the head of a small and poorly trained army whose soldiers were more courageous than effective and who tended to fight naked to the waist, armed only with a few axes and some heavy swords made of poor-grade metal. <br>Labienus and his legionaries advanced inexorably. Camulogenus prepared his defense. He didn&#x2019;t wait in the city for the Romans to arrive, however; he set up his camp in a swamp, in the heart of the moist zone that surrounds Lutï¿½ce. <br>Soon enough Labienus arrived and the war began. The impeccably disciplined Romans, with their bronze helmets and their steel chest plates, advanced in tight formations. The legionaries were used to fighting on solid ground, having trained on open plains; now they found themselves getting sucked into the shifting terrain between water and land, a place where even small boats went aground and men drowned. The cavalry was useless; the horses&#x2019; hooves stuck fast in the mud. <br>The Gauls, on the other hand, were right at home in this kind of wetland. They descended upon the enemy troops and slaughtered the proud soldiers of Rome, who were unable to defend themselves against this onslaught. By the time night had fallen, Roman blood reddened the stagnant water. Labienus faced reality and had the trumpets blast a long mournful note of retreat. Lutï¿½ce erupted in joy. The city was saved and the invaders pushed back! <br>Labienus, enraged, decided to wreak revenge on these stubborn Gauls and, pushing along the edges of the Seine, moved to attack Metlosedum&#x2014;what is today Melun&#x2014;another city built in the bend of the meandering Seine. <br>Metlosedum was defenseless, most of its men having joined Camulogenus at Lutï¿½ce, and was inhabited mainly by women and old men. They tried to push back the legionaries with their bare hands. What occurred wasn&#x2019;t even a battle worthy of the name but a cold-blooded affair of throat-cutting and disembowelment. The Romans rammed their lances into the guts of anyone who looked as if they might oppose the new order, pillaging reserves of wheat and desecrating the altars of the divinities, sacking the wealthier houses. And then they left, leaving behind them a city in ruins. <br>It was on Lutï¿½ce that Labienus wanted to exact his revenge, however. He had no intention to return to Caesar and admit to the shame of his defeat. In the middle of the night, he gathered his officers together in his tent and gave them a speech worthy of a virile Roman general. <br>&#x201c;We cannot expect reinforcements. It&#x2019;s up to our legions to crush the Gauls and take their city. You will conquer these barbarians for the glory of the empire ...</p><h2>Towards A Philosophy Of Education (Charlotte Mason&#39;s Original Homeschooling Series)</h2><p>Towards a Philosophy of Education is Charlotte Mason&#39;s final book in her Homeschooling Series, written after years of seeing her approach in action. This volume gives the best overview of her philosophy, and includes the final version of her 20 Principles. This book is particularly directed to parents of older children, about ages 12 and up, but is a valuable overview for parents of younger children as well. Part I develops and discusses her 20 principles; Part II discusses the practical application of her theories. Charlotte Mason was a late nineteenth-century British educator whose ideas were far ahead of her time. She believed that children are born persons worthy of respect, rather than blank slates, and that it was better to feed their growing minds with living literature and vital ideas and knowledge, rather than dry facts and knowledge filtered and pre-digested by the teacher. Her method of education, still used by some private schools and many homeschooling families, is gentle and flexible, especially with younger children, and includes first-hand exposure to great and noble ideas through books in each school subject, conveying wonder and arousing curiosity, and through reflection upon great art, music, and poetry; nature observation as the primary means of early science teaching; use of manipulatives and real-life application to understand mathematical concepts and learning to reason, rather than rote memorization and working endless sums; and an emphasis on character and on cultivating and maintaining good personal habits. Schooling is teacher-directed, not child-led, but school time should be short enough to allow students free time to play and to pursue their own worthy interests such as handicrafts. Traditional Charlotte Mason schooling is firmly based on Christianity, although the method is also used successfully by secular families and families of other religions.</p><p></p><h2>Family Values (A Leo Waterman Mystery)</h2><p><p>Returning to Seattle after a business trip, retired PI Leo Waterman is shocked to find his girlfriend, Rebecca Duvall, unconscious on the bathroom floor, her house filled with gas.

She leaps exhilaratingly among verbal registers?from "kenatoprosthesis" to "trailer skirt," from "Arkansas toe" and "pinball" to "Ultima Thule." And she loves double meanings?"Morning glories. What's yours." Her uncharacteristically extroverted, ethnographic project also shows her sense of humor?"Her Aunt Flo said she hadn't had any in so long she'd done growed back together." In sorting these glittering, interlocking fragments of "self-conscious Southern poetry, preposterous as a wedding dress," some readers will wish Wright had included notes, or explained her extensive back story; but no one will need more information to cherish Wright's latest "once-and-for-all thing, opaque and revelatory, ceaselessly burning." <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Vegetable Gardening: The Complete Guide to Growing More Than 40 Popular Vegetables in Any Space (CompanionHouse Books) Beginner-Friendly Advice for Planting, Container Gardens, Raised Beds, and More</h2><p>At a time when natural, organic food is at a premium and consumers want to know where their food comes from, a home vegetable garden seems like a no-brainer.

It attempts to convey, in everyday language understandable to the layman, some of the unconscious mental processes which underlie the feelings and action of normal, adult men and women.<br><br> The characteristic feature of human psychology is the intense and continual interplay of the impulses of love on the one hand and hatred and agression on the other. Joan Riviere opens this joint study with an analysis of hate, greed, and aggression, and in the second section Melanie Klein talks about the forces of love, guilt, and reparation. Tracing the impulses in question back to their origins in infancy, the authors point out many features of adult mental life which evidence the persistence of earlier modes of thinking. Then they discuss some of the "infinitely various, subtle and complicated adaptations" by means of which each individual tries, all his life, to keep a balance between the life-brining and the destructive elements of his nature in order to achieve the maximum of security and gratification.</p><p></p><h2>Spouse on Haunted Hill (A Haunted Guesthouse Mystery)</h2><p><b>Alison&#x2019;s shady ex needs to use her haunted guesthouse as a hideout in the latest from the national bestselling author of <i>Ghost in the Wind.<br><br></i></b>Where Alison Kerby&#x2019;s ex-husband goes, trouble follows.

It was one of those things you say to yourself when things aren't exactly going your way, and they weren't going mine right now. I was standing just short of the security line at Newark Liberty International Airport (the longest name for an airport in the continental United States, but that's just a guess) where at any moment-I had been told-my daughter, Melissa, now thirteen but no less sensible than she ever had been, would be returned to me after having been held captive against my will for almost a whole week.<br><br>Okay, she'd been visiting her father in Los Angeles during a school break that took into account all presidential holidays and the remainder of a week, but to me that was the equivalent of kidnapping. Sure, Liss had been willing to go visit Steven, but that didn't make it the right thing to do. He had not been given (in my mind) the nickname The Swine without some cause.<br><br>"What's the end?" Maxie Malone, to my right, was watching up the corridor as I was, despite my urging that she head on down past security and see what was holding Melissa up. Maxie could do that because very few people could see her.<br><br>She was dead. More on that in a minute.<br><br>"The end of my patience," I said into the little Bluetooth device I wore on my ear so I could talk to Maxie without people thinking I needed psychiatric observation. "She was supposed to be back here three hours ago."<br><br>"It was snowing," Maxie reminded me as if I didn't know that. "You're lucky she's coming home today at all. They almost closed the airport."<br><br>Since when was Maxie the Weather Channel? "That's not the point," I explained through semiclenched teeth. "The point is that I was supposed to have my daughter back at two and it is now five fifteen. That is worse than two."<br><br>"You're overreacting," said Maxie.<br><br>I looked around for a kettle and a pot to see what color they each might think the other was. Oddly I found none.<br><br>"So she's a little late. You know how the airlines are." Maxie had once told me she'd never been in an airplane in her life. Maxie had been murdered at the age of twenty-eight and now existed-lived would be inaccurate-in my huge Victorian guesthouse back in Harbor Haven, New Jersey, roughly an hour's drive from here when it wasn't snowing.<br><br>"It's not the airlines. It's Liss's father. He probably made it snow so I wouldn't get her back."<br><br>Maxie rolled her eyes and clicked her tongue. I gave her a sharp look, which drew a quick glance from the TSA guard at one of the fluoroscope machines. Great. Now they'd think I was a hijacker because I was trying to glare significantly at one of my resident ghosts.<br><br>Perhaps I should explain.<br><br>After divorcing The Swine I had taken some money from the settlement-okay, all the money from the settlement-and some from a lawsuit I'd settled with an ex-employer with wandering hands and bought the big house in Harbor Haven, the town where I'd grown up. While restoring the house with an eye toward opening it to tourists, I'd taken a bucket of wallboard compound to the head (Maxie to this day swears she wasn't responsible), and once I'd come to had seen two people in my house I had not known were there.<br><br>Maxie was one of them. Paul Harrison, the aspiring private detective who had been Maxie's bodyguard for the last twelve hours of her life, was the other. The reason I hadn't seen them before was that almost nobody could see them-they were ghosts.<br><br>It seemed seeing ghosts ran in my family. My mother and Melissa apparently had the ability since birth, which they told me about only after I'd been clonked on the head and thought I was having dangerous hallucinations. This was the dynamic in my clan.<br><br>Paul and Maxie had been murdered in my new house and oddly were not happy about that, so they'd insisted I find out who had done the murdering. We eventually did sort that out, the perpetrator was now in prison and would be for quite some time and I figured the two ghosts would move out and let me have my guesthouse on the Jersey Shore.<br><br>No such luck.<br><br>At first neither of the ghosts was able to move beyond my property line, which was the beach in the back of the house, the street in front of the house and some nebulous line between houses on either side. Eventually Maxie spontaneously developed the ability to travel, but Paul was still housebound and grumpy about it. He was a lovely guy, but he tended to take things like being cooped up in one house for all eternity personally.<br><br>"Why don't you go up and see if she's in yet?" I suggested to Maxie. "They're not going to arrest you for breaking security."<br><br>"Will you calm down?" she said. "I miss Melissa, too, but you don't see me getting all antsy."<br><br>It was true. Maxie considered herself something of a big sister to my daughter, and Liss adored the brassy ghost, particularly since Maxie loves nothing better than to annoy me to the point of distraction, which Melissa considers hilarious. Even so, I was anxious to see my daughter after a week away. Five years to college. There was a thought I didn't want to have.<br><br>"I just-" I began.<br><br>Maxie rose toward the ceiling to get a better viewpoint. "They're coming out," she reported.<br><br>Immediately I started to jockey for position, but so did every other person waiting for a loved one (or maybe someone they didn't even like) to walk down the corridor. This area could see as many as three flights arrive at once, so even in this weather it was fairly crowded with New Jerseyans, and there's nothing we like better than nudging each other out of the way.<br><br>Unfortunately many of the New Jerseyans (don't ever call us "Jersey-ites") in front of me were tall, or at least tall enough that I couldn't see Melissa-or anything except the somewhat hairy neck of the guy in front of me-as the ex-passengers approached. "Do you see her?" I asked Maxie.<br><br>Maxie started to giggle, and that was always a bad sign.<br><br>"Yeah," she managed to squeak out.<br><br>"Why is that funny?"<br><br>The hairy neck in front of me wasn't laughing. Neither was anyone else in line. That let out the possibility that Jon Stewart had disembarked here or that a group of chimpanzees in flight attendant uniforms were juggling on their way out of the tunnel. Because chimps are funny.<br><br>"You'll see," Maxie chuckled, and then she rose higher either so that I'd have to yell to talk to her or so she could see better. There were no hairy-necked ghosts hovering near the ceiling, although one rather distinguished elderly gentleman dressed for a flight in 1974 was hip-deep in the floor of the terminal. He checked his watch as if time was actually a consideration of his.<br><br>I didn't have time, I'm saying, to assess Maxie's proclamation before my very own Melissa, who seemed taller after being gone only a week, squeezed her way through the crowd (practically hip-checking Hairy Neck) and gave me a measured but affectionate hug.<br><br>"Where's Josh?" she asked. That was the kind of greeting I got from my daughter. A lot of girls would have said, "Mom! I missed you so much! Thank goodness I don't live with that demon full-time!" But no. I got a thirteen-year-old asking where my boyfriend of two years might be.<br><br>"He couldn't make it tonight; he has to shovel out in front of his store." Josh Kaplan owned Madison Paints, an independent store in Asbury Park. "The town issues summonses if you don't shovel. But hey, don't worry, he managed to send your next favorite adult." I gave Liss a consolation hug with my right arm.<br><br>"I thought that was me," said a voice I knew too well. A voice that I couldn't be hearing. A voice I absolutely didn't want to be hearing.<br><br>"Don't make me play favorites, Dad," said my daughter.<br><br>Sure enough, standing just to the left (mine, not his) of Hairy Neck was my ex-husband, Steven Rendell.<br><br>The Swine.<br><br>"What are you doing here?" I sort of growled as Maxie, guffawing her way down from the ceiling, pointed at me.<br><br>"You should see your face!" she gloated. Melissa shot Maxie a look to indicate she was taking the gag too far. Maxie didn't notice, or that was what she wanted us to think.<br><br>"Nice welcome," Steven said. "Can't I come out and visit once in a while?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Melissa dragged her carry-on-size bag with the one sort of shaky wheel, and started toward the exit. "Come on," she said, I think to Maxie. The ghost nodded and floated on behind her.<br><br>"I just wanted to come out and see you for a couple of days," my ex continued as if I hadn't made it clear that was a bad idea. "Do you have a room empty?"<br><br>It was February and the tourist trade down the shore (as real Jerseyans call the coastline) was not exactly booming. I had a grand total of three guests at the moment and none scheduled for the following week.<br><br>"We're all full up," I told Steven.<br><br>"Good for you!" The Swine liked to pretend that any business success I might have would be a complete surprise, because he thought I didn't actually know what I was doing. Yeah, I only had three guests. February. Shore. Remember? "You have somewhere you can stash me, right?"<br><br>I noticed he was walking slowly, more so than I remembered, but then, maybe age was starting to catch up with him. Steven had to be in his early forties by now, because I was in my late thirties. "Not really," I said. "Why not catch a flight back out to California while you can and save the cost of a hotel?"<br><br>"Ally." Steven knew for a fact that I absolutely hated being called "Ally." I gave him a look. "Sorry. Alison. Can you just wait up a second?"<br><br>Melissa (and by extension Maxie) already had a ten-yard lead on us. "Steven, I haven't seen our daughter-my daughter-in a week. Why would I hang back with you, when I didn't want to see you at all?" It seemed a logical question. The Swine had left us when Melissa was only eight, and he had done so to go live the Southern California lifestyle (which as far as I could tell was like New Jersey but with less gluten) with a woman named . . . Bambi? Barbie? That was four women ago, so I couldn't really remember.<br><br>"I have a problem." It was hardly worth noting that The Swine always had a problem. That was why the child support checks were late, when he managed to send them at all. That was why it hadn't been, until now, a "good time" for Melissa to come visit him in sunnier climes. Steven saying he had a problem was like LeBron James mentioning that he was taller than some.<br><br>"Fine, you can have a room at the guesthouse," I relented. "But only for a couple of nights. I have a new group of guests coming in a few days." That was an outright lie, but fight fire with fire, I always say.<br><br>"That's not it." Steven held my left biceps to slow me down, which considering that I was barely walking at this point, meant I had to stop. "I mean, yes, I want the room, but I figured I could get that. I have a real problem."<br><br>"And a charming way to convince me I should help." I shook his hand off my arm and started after my daughter, who was conversing openly with the invisible woman over her head. "What's the problem?"<br><br>"Some people want to kill me."<br><br>I kept walking. "Again?" I asked.<br><br>Two<br><br>The drive home was slow and, from Steven's end, quiet. Melissa and Steven did not have a lot of details to share about their week together-they'd gone to Disneyland (of course) and the Chinese Theater (even more of course) and gotten their picture taken under the Hollywood sign. I would have to consult with Maxie, who had "mad computer skills," she said, about Photoshopping The Swine out of that one.<br><br>Maxie was sitting with her head out of the car, which made it look as if she were feeling the breeze despite the fact that she couldn't. So she did not contribute much except when she decided to drop down and see if anyone was saying anything she would consider interesting. We were, apparently, not doing that very much.<br><br>I had not mentioned Steven's comment at the airport to Maxie, since I'd had no time alone with her and didn't want to alarm Melissa over what I was sure would not be a serious issue. Steven was always getting involved in somewhat sketchy business deals, confident in his ability to talk his way out of trouble, and about seventy percent of the time he was able to do just that.<br><br>It was the other thirty percent that offered him some challenges, and probably would have ended up contributing to our divorce if Bobbi (or Bitsy, or something) hadn't gotten in the way first. I was really young when we got married. That's not an excuse, but it is an explanation.<br><br>"So, what's Dad's house like, Liss?" I asked when the slick roadway on the Garden State Parkway eased to the point that I could stop leaning forward, coaxing the Volvo's ancient defroster to make the highway visible.<br><br>"Um . . ." Liss wasn't often at a loss for words. "We didn't exactly stay at Dad's house."<br><br>"I'm having some renovations done," The Swine jumped in. "We had a suite at a hotel for the time Melissa was there, because nothing is too good for my girl."<br><br>I couldn't actually turn my head at the moment, but I could picture Liss rolling her eyes at that one. Her father could snow her (if you'll pardon the expression), but he had to work harder than that.<br><br>"A hotel?" None of the texts or phone calls had mentioned that.<br><br>"It was really nice," Liss told me. "One night we got room service and all they brought was a soft pretzel."<br><br>"Uh-huh." I didn't care much for the way this particular vacation was sounding. We didn't talk again for a while.<br><br>The truth was, what had fallen on New Jersey that day was hardly a significant snowfall. But it was the third one in a week and we were running out of places to put the stuff. I know some people see snow and think of lovely evenings spent watching it pile up. You never hear rhapsodic tales of shoveling and driving in snow on a dark night.</p><h2>The Lord of Vik-lo: A Novel of Viking Age Ireland (Norsemen Saga)</h2><p>Book III of the ongoing Norsemen Saga. In this riveting follow-up to Fin Gall and Dubh-linn, Thorgrim Night Wolf makes ready to leave the Viking town of Dubh-linn for the long journey back to his home in Norway.

But the gods have other plans, and Thorgrim and his men wash up in the small Viking longphort of Vï¿½k-lï¿½. Thinking themselves among friends, they soon learn that the opposite is true, that Grimarr Giant, the Lord of Vï¿½k-lï¿½, has reason to want Thorgrim and his son Harald dead. In a world where they cannot tell friend from foe, a world of violence at sea and on land, Thorgrim, Harald, Ornolf, Starri and their band of Norsemen find themselves once again fighting not just for plunder, but for their very survival.</p><p>Jim Nelson was born and raised in Lewiston, Maine and graduated from UCLA with a degree in motion picture/television production.

Aster Bunnymund. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stop or I&#x2019;ll be scrambled!&#x201d; he shouted over his shoulder to his friend Fog. In this new game of Warrior Egg tag, to be scrambled meant you had been caught by the opposing egg team and therefore, had lost a point.<br> <br>Sascha and her brother, Petter, were in hot pursuit, riding Warrior Eggs of their own. The matchstick-thin legs of the mechanical eggs moved so fast, they were a blur.<br> <br>&#x201c;Comin&#x2019; in for the scramble shot!&#x201d; Petter warned. His long tag pole, with the egg-shaped tip, was inches away from Sascha.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eat my yolk,&#x201d; Sascha said with a triumphant laugh. She pushed a button, and suddenly, her Warrior Egg sprouted wings. She flew over the others, reaching the finish line first.<br> <br>William the Absolute Youngest slowed to a trot. &#x201c;Wings!&#x201d; he grumbled. &#x201c;They aren&#x2019;t even in the rules!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I invented them yesterday,&#x201d; said Sascha. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing in the rules that says you can&#x2019;t use &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br> <br>Soon Sascha was helping the youngest William construct his own set of eggbot wings. She liked the youngest William. He always tried to act older, and she appreciated his determination and spirit. Petter and Fog, feeling wild and industrious, catapulted themselves to the hollow of a tall tree where they had erected a hideout devoted to solving ancient mysteries, such as: why was there such a thing as bedtime, and what could they do to eliminate it forever?<br> <br>Across the clearing, in a tree house perched high in the branches of Big Root&#x2014;the tree at the center of the village&#x2014;their friend Katherine contently watched the children play.<br> <br>The air shimmered with their happy laughter. Many months had passed since the battle at the Earth&#x2019;s core during which Pitch, the Nightmare King, had been soundly defeated by Katherine and the other Guardians: Ombric, the wizard; his apprentice, Nicholas St. North; their friend Nightlight; and their newest ally, the Pookan rabbit known as E. Aster Bunnymund. Pitch, who had hungered for the dreams of innocent children and longed to replace them with nightmares, had vowed with his Fearlings to make all the children of Earth live in terror. But since the great battle, he had not been seen or heard from, and Katherine was beginning to hope that Pitch had been vanquished forever.<br> <br>As for Katherine and her battle mates, their lives were forever changed. The Man in the Moon himself had given them the title of &#x201c;Guardians.&#x201d; They were heroes now, sworn to protect the children of not just Santoff Claussen, but the entire planet. They had defeated Pitch, and their greatest challenge at present was how to manage the peace. The &#x201c;nightmare&#x201d; of Pitch&#x2019;s reign seemed to be over.<br> <br>The other children of the village now filled their days with mischief and magic. Bunnymund, who could burrow through the Earth with astonishing speed, had created a series of tunnels for them, connecting the village with his home on Easter Island and with other amazing outposts around the world, and the children had become intrepid explorers. On any given day they might journey to the African savanna to visit the lions, cheetahs, and hippopotami&#x2014;Ombric had taught them a number of animal languages, so they had numerous stories to hear and tell. Many of the creatures had already heard of their amazing adventures.<br> <br>The children also regularly circled through Easter Island for the latest chocolate confection Bunnymund had invented, and could still be back in time for dinner and games with Bunnymund&#x2019;s mechanical egg comrades. The eggs were once Bunnymund&#x2019;s warriors; now they helped the children build all manner of interesting contraptions, from intricate egg-shaped puzzles where every piece was egg-shaped (a nearly impossible and frankly unexplainable feat) to egg-shaped submarines. But no matter where the children roamed or what they did to occupy their days, whenever they returned home to Santoff Claussen, it had never seemed so lovely to them.<br> <br>As Katherine sat in her tree house, she put her arm around Kailash, her great Himalayan Snow Goose, and looked out on her beloved village. The forest that surrounded and protected Santoff Claussen had bloomed into a kind of eternal spring. The massive oaks and vines that had once formed an impenetrable wall against the outside world were thick with leaves of the deepest green. The huge, spear-size thorns that had once covered the vines grew pliant and blossomed with sweet-scented flowers.<br> <br>Katherine loved the smell, and drew a deep breath of it. In the distance she could see Nicholas St. North walking with the beautiful, ephemeral Spirit of the Forest. She was more radiant now than ever before. Her gossamer robes were resplendent with blooms that shimmered like jewels. North was deep in conversation with her, so Katherine decided to investigate. She climbed on to Kailash&#x2019;s back and flew down into the clearing, just in time to see William the Absolute Youngest try out the new wings with which he&#x2019;d outfitted his Warrior Egg. He landed and trotted over to her.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Want to race with us, Katherine?&#x201d; he asked. He gave Kailash a scratch on her neck, and the goose honked a hello.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will later!&#x201d; Katherine said, smiling. She waved to her friends and headed into the forest, realizing that it had been quite some time since any of the children had asked her to play, and an even longer time since she had accepted. In joining the world of the Guardians, she was in a strange new phase of her life&#x2014;where she was neither child nor adult. As she watched the youngest William fly away with Sascha close behind him, she couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a bit torn.<br> <br>Then she heard North&#x2019;s hearty laugh and, underneath that, the more musical tones of the Spirit of the Forest. Katherine hurried toward them, thinking that it was hard to believe that when North first came to Santoff Claussen with his band of outlaws, it had been with the intent to steal its treasures. The Spirit of the Forest, the village&#x2019;s last line of defense, had turned North&#x2019;s crew of cutthroats and bandits into stone statues&#x2014;hideous, hunched elves. But she had spared North, for he alone among them was pure of heart.<br> <br>When Katherine caught up with the Spirit and North, they were standing in that most strange and eerie part of the forest&#x2014;the place where North&#x2019;s men stood frozen in time, like stones in a forgotten burial site. With the Spirit&#x2019;s help, North was bringing his bandits back to human form.<br> <br>As the Spirit touched the head of each statue, North repeated the same spell, &#x201c;From flesh to stone and back again. To serve with honor, your one true friend.&#x201d; And one by one they emerged from their frozen poses. To North&#x2019;s great amusement, they hadn&#x2019;t regained their size. They were still the same height as their stone selves&#x2014;about two feet tall, with bulbous noses and high, childlike voices.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome back,&#x201d; North called out, slapping each of the elfin men on the back.<br> <br>The men stamped their little feet and waved their little arms to get their blood flowing again, and soon the children, drawn by North&#x2019;s laughter, arrived. They were shocked; they often played among these small stone men, and now that they were moving&#x2014;were alive, in fact&#x2014;the children were most intrigued. Tall William, the first son of Old William, towered over them. Even the youngest William was overjoyed&#x2014;at last he was taller than someone else.<br> <br>While the children watched, the little men kneeled before North. They took on new names as they pledged to follow their former outlaw leader in a new life of goodness. Gregor of the Mighty Stink became Gregor of the Mighty Smile. Sergei the Terrible was now Sergei the Giggler, and so on.<br> <br>It was an odd but auspicious moment, especially for North. He remembered his wild, unruly life as a bandit and the many dark deeds that he and these fellows had committed. He&#x2019;d become a hero, a man of great learning, good humor, and some wisdom. So much had changed since that moment when he faced the temptation of the Spirit of the Forest, when he had rejected her promises of treasure and had chosen to save the children of Santoff Claussen.<br> <br>North turned and looked at young Katherine. He felt the full weight of all they had been through. They had both changed. It was a change he did not fully understand, but he knew he was glad for it. For though these dwarfish fellows in front of him had once been his comrades in crime, North, in his heart, had been alone. But that was past. This was a different day. And through the friendship he now knew, he could change bad men to good and stone back to flesh.<br> <br>North gently asked his old confederates to rise. They did so gladly.<br> <br>Peace had indeed come.<br> <br>Katherine took North&#x2019;s hand, and together they welcomed these baffled little men to the world of Santoff Claussen.</p><h2>Light Warrior: Connecting with the Spiritual Power of Fierce Love</h2><p>Within the light no shadow can existA light worker is anyone who has heard the internal call to make a difference in the world.

It&nbsp;is a study of the Argentine character, a prescription for the modernization of Latin America, and a protest against the tyranny of the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas (1835&#x2013;1852). The book brings nineteenth-century Latin American history to life even as it raises questions still being debated today&#x2014;questions regarding the "civilized" city versus the "barbaric" countryside, the treatment of indigenous and African populations, and the classically liberal plan of modernization.&nbsp;<i>Facundo&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;celebrated and frequently anthologized portraits of&nbsp;Quiroga and other colorful characters give readers an exhilarating sense of Argentine culture in the making.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Combining history, sociology, and political commentary, Sarmiento explores the impact of Argentine geography on the life of the gaucho; chronicles the often bloody political and military adventures of Facundo; examines the reign of the tyrannical ruler Juan Manuel de Rosas; and ponders the future of Argentina. This edition includes an informative introduction and a chronology of Sarmiento&#39;s life and times. It also restores the original author&#39;s note that was dropped for the 1868 English-language edition - and that is crucial to our understanding of Sarmiento and his views.An writer,&nbsp;educator, and activist, Domingo F.

The Grinch tries to stop Christmas from arriving by stealing all the presents and food from the village, but much to his surprise it comes anyway. Could Christmas be more than presents?</p><p>"The Grinch <i>hated</i> Christmas! The whole Christmas season! / Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason." Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His "wonderful, awful" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.<p> Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>The Grinch, whose heart is two sizes too small, hates Who-ville&#39;s holiday celebrations, and plans to steal all the presents to prevent Christmas from coming. To his amazement, Christmas comes anyway, and the Grinch discovers the true meaning of the holiday.</p><h2>Broadway Baby: The Sound of Music, My Favorite Things: Based on the song by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein</h2><p><b>Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic piece comes to life in&nbsp;<i>Broadway Baby: The Sound of Music, My Favorite Things</i>.

A silver Rolls-Royce screeches to a stop at the neon-lit doorway of a 52nd Street jazz club. Behind the wheel is a glamorous brunette, a chinchilla stole draped over her shoulder and a long cigarette holder clinched in her teeth. After taking a pull from a small silver flask, she glides past the bouncer into the murky depths of the Three Deuces. The Jazz Baroness has arrived.<br><br> Raised in fairy-tale splendor, Kathleen Annie Pannonica Rothschild de Koenigswarter (known as &#x201c;Nica&#x201d;) piloted her own plane across the English Channel, married a French baron, fought in the French Resistance, and had five children. Then she heard a recording of Thelonious Monk&#x2019;s &#x201c;Round Midnight.&#x201d; Inspired by the liberating spirit of jazz, Nica left her family, moved to Manhattan, and began haunting the city&#x2019;s nightclubs.<br><br> The tabloids first splashed her name across the headlines after Charlie Parker died in her hotel suite&#x2015;a scandal that cast a dark shadow over the rest of her life. She retreated from the public eye, but through her ongoing ministrations to Monk and dozens of other musicians she became a legend. Nearly a score of jazz compositions have been written in her honor, including two of the most beloved classics of the genre: Horace Silver&#x2019;s &#x201c;Nica&#x2019;s Dream&#x201d; and Monk&#x2019;s &#x201c;Pannonica.&#x201d;<br><br><em>Nica&#x2019;s Dream</em> traces the story of a fascinating woman across her thirty-year reign as the Jazz Baroness, but it also explores a transformative era in twentieth-century American culture. Based on interviews with musicians, family members, historians, and artists, David Kastin&#x2019;s probing biography unwraps the life of this enigmatic figure and evokes the vibrancy of New York during the birth of bebop, the first stirrings of the Beat Generation, and the advent of abstract expressionism. 8 pages of black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Praise for <em>Nica&#x2019;s Dream</em>:<br><br> &#x201c;Finally!

This isn't your mother's sex book: It honestly and unapologetically teaches teens the practicalities of being sexually active and how to stay safe.<br> With illustrations by <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> cartoon artist Michael Capozzola, this book features chapters on foreplay, different forms of sex (all of them!), masturbation, sexual orientation, gender identity, virginity, and safe sex.

She is an avid pickler and chef, and the mother of three sons.</p><p>"This guide to teen sexuality by the host of the hilarious comedy podcast <em>The Midwest Teen Sex Show</em>is chatty and expansively informative. Maintaining an offhand, non-judgmental tone throughout, it concisely covers topics from sexual identity to STIs and the basics of reproduction (and avoiding it), as well as some less commonly explored territory in books on sex for teens, such as fetishes and kink. Though Hasler's deadpan style plays better on the show than on the page, there are plentiful flashes of humor, and the simple cartoon-style graphics aid in both a comedic and an informational sense. While a lot of the content is not new, the highlight is the Q&amp;A at the end of each chapter, which includes such timely gems as a warning about the possible legal and emotional repercussions of digitally sending or even printing out naked pictures to give to others.

Hasler, a columnist who answers teens' questions in her own 'webisodes' and on the school speaking circuit, is more colloquial than clinical as she delivers a wealth of accurate information. Readers will find basic facts about anatomy, hygiene, and birth control (Toothpaste is not a spermicide'), but they'll also discover straightforward coverage of more typically taboo subjects, such as sex toys, fantasies, and fetishes. From definitions of GLBT terms to guides to safe sex, regardless of teens' sexual orientation, the book's inclusiveness is rare and welcome. Never judgmental (one section is entitled 'Shame, Guilt, and Other Nonsense'), Hasler encourages teens to take ownership of their bodies, make informed decisions, and get help when necessary, especially if they think they have an STD: 'Don't sit around . . . writing e-mails to online health forums.' <strong>Lighthearted cartoons and well-chosen resources complete this indispensable guide for teens seeking reliable, explicit facts about healthy sex.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>What Makes This Book So Great: Re-Reading the Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy</h2><p><p>As any reader of Jo Walton's <i>Among Others</i> might guess, Walton is both an inveterate reader of SF and fantasy, and a chronic re-reader of books.

Introduction <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>This book is made up of a series of blog posts I wrote on Tor.com between July 2008 and February 2011. They appear here in order, and with their original dates. These are about a fifth of the total posts I made during that time. You don&#x2019;t have to read them in order, but sometimes one will refer back to another and develop an argument. I wrote them as blog posts, and so they are inherently conversational and interactive&#x2014;they were written in dialogue with each other and also with the people reading and commenting. I think they are still interesting when taken out of that context, but if reading them here makes you splutter &#x201c;but, but&#x201d; and reach for the follow-up key, the posts are still online, and I am still reading comments. Interaction remains a possibility. I&#x2019;m still writing new posts too. (If, however, you are reading this in a far distant future in which this is no longer a possibility, hello! Nobody would have liked to talk to someone from your world more than I would, and any regrets are on both sides.) <br>The brief I was given when I started writing for Tor.com was to talk about what I was re-reading. Patrick Nielsen Hayden said that I was always saying &#x201c;smart things about books nobody else had thought about for ages,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s what I tried to do. You won&#x2019;t find any reviews here. Reviews are naturally concerned with new books, and are first reactions. Here I&#x2019;m mostly talking about older books, and these are my thoughts on reading them again. There are posts on books in many genres and published between 1871 and 2008, but the emphasis is on older science fiction and fantasy. There are also posts here about the act of reading and re-reading, and about the genres of science fiction and fantasy and the boundaries between them. When I talk about books that aren&#x2019;t science fiction and fantasy, I&#x2019;m looking at them from a genre perspective, whether it&#x2019;s how George Eliot should have single-handedly invented science fiction or wishing wistfully that A. S. Byatt had read Delany. <br>My general approach to the books in these pieces is as a genre-reader, but not as a generic reader. There&#x2019;s no impersonality here, no attempt at objectivity. These are my thoughts and opinions, for what they&#x2019;re worth, my likes and dislikes, my quirks and prejudices and enthusiasms. I select the books I re-read based on what I feel like reading at the moment, so these are my tastes. I do from time to time write about books I don&#x2019;t enjoy, for one reason or another, but what you&#x2019;ll mostly find are attempts to consider the question I ask in the title of this collection&#x2014;what makes this book so great? <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>JULY 15, 2008 <br>2. Why I Re-read <br> <br>There are two kinds of people in the world, those who re-read and those who don&#x2019;t. No, don&#x2019;t be silly, there are far more than two kinds of people in the world. There are even people who don&#x2019;t read at all. (What <i>do</i> they think about on buses?) But there are two kinds of readers in the world, though, those who re-read and those who don&#x2019;t. Sometimes people who don&#x2019;t re-read look at me oddly when I mention that I do. &#x201c;There are so many books,&#x201d; they say, &#x201c;and so little time. If I live to be a mere Methuselah of 800, and read a book a week for 800 years, I will only have the chance to read 40,000 books, and my readpile is already 90,000 and starting to topple! If I re-read, why, I&#x2019;ll never get through the new ones.&#x201d; This is in fact true, they never will. And my readpile is also, well, let&#x2019;s just say it&#x2019;s pretty large, and that&#x2019;s just the pile of unread books in my house, not the list of books I&#x2019;d theoretically like to read someday, many of which have not even been written yet. That list probably is at 90,000, especially if I include books that will be written in the next 800 years by people as yet unborn and books written by aliens as yet unmet. Wow, it&#x2019;s probably well over 90,000! When will I ever read all those books? <br>Well, I read a lot more than one book a week. Even when I&#x2019;m fantastically busy rushing about having a good time and visiting my friends and family, like right now, I average a book every couple of days. If I&#x2019;m at home and stuck in bed, which happens sometimes, then I&#x2019;m doing nothing but reading. I can get through four or six books in a day. So I could say that there are never going to be sufficient books to fill the voracious maw that is me. Get writing! I need books! If I didn&#x2019;t re-read I&#x2019;d run out of books eventually and that would be terrible! <br>But this argument is disingenuous, because in fact there is that towering pile of unread books in my bedroom at home, and even a little one in my bedroom here in my aunt&#x2019;s house. I don&#x2019;t re-read to make the new books last longer. That might be how it started.&#x2026; The truth is that there are, at any given time, a whole lot more books I don&#x2019;t want to read than books I do. <br>Right now, I don&#x2019;t want to read <i>Storming the Heavens: Soldiers, Emperors, and Civilians in the Roman Empire</i> by Antonio Santosuosso, and/or <i>The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade</i> by Maria Eugenia Aubet and Mary Turton. I do want to read both of these books, in theory, enough theory that they came home with me from the library, but in practice they both have turgid academic prose that it&#x2019;s work to slog through. I am going to try to slog through the Phoenician one before I go home to Montreal and the book goes home to Cardiff library, but the other one is going back unread. (The Phoenicians, unlike the Romans, are insufficiently written about for me to turn down a solid book for bad prose.) But yesterday, when I was picking up books to take to read on the train to London, both of them glowered at me unwelcomingly. I was already in the middle of one (pretty good) book on Hannibal&#x2019;s army, I wanted fiction. And I didn&#x2019;t just want any old fiction, I wanted something good and absorbing and interesting enough to suck me in and hold my attention on the train so that I wouldn&#x2019;t notice the most boring scenery in the world&#x2014;to me at least, who has taken the train between Cardiff and London quite often before. I didn&#x2019;t want to have to look out of the window at Didcot Parkway. I had some new fiction out of the library, but what I wanted was something engrossing, something reliable, and for me, that means something I have read before. <br>When I re-read, I know what I&#x2019;m getting. It&#x2019;s like revisiting an old friend. An unread book holds wonderful unknown promise, but also threatens disappointment. A re-read is a known quantity. A new book that&#x2019;s been sitting there for a little while waiting to be read, already not making the cut from being &#x201c;book on shelf&#x201d; to &#x201c;book in hand&#x201d; for some time, for some reason, often can&#x2019;t compete with going back to something I know is good, somewhere I want to revisit. Sometimes I totally kick myself over this, because when I finally get around to something unread that&#x2019;s been sitting there I don&#x2019;t know how I can have passed it over with that &#x201c;cold rice pudding&#x201d; stare while the universe cooled and I read C. J. Cherryh&#x2019;s <i>The Pride of Chanur</i> for the nineteenth time. <br>My ideal relationship with a book is that I will read it for the first time entirely unspoiled. I won&#x2019;t know anything whatsoever about it, it will be wonderful, it will be exciting and layered and complex and I will be excited by it, and I will re-read it every year or so for the rest of my life, discovering more about it every time, and every time remembering the circumstances in which I first read it. (I was re-reading Doris Lessing&#x2019;s <i>The Good Terrorist</i>. &#x201c;The first time I read this was in a cafe in Lytham St. Annes in 1987,&#x201d; I mentioned. &#x201c;How can you remember that?&#x201d; my husband asked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. It was raining, and I was eating a poached egg on toast.&#x201d; Other people remember where they were when they heard that Princess Diana was dead. I haven&#x2019;t a clue, but I pretty much always remember where I was when I first read things.) <br>This ideal relationship doesn&#x2019;t always work out. Even when I like the book in the first place, sometimes a re-read is a disappointment. This usually happens when the thing that was good about the book was a temporary shininess that wears off quickly. There are books that pall when I know their plots, or become too familiar with their characters. And sometimes I read a book that I used to love and find it seems to have been replaced with a shallow book that&#x2019;s only somewhat similar. (This happens most often with children&#x2019;s books I haven&#x2019;t read since I was a child, but it has happened with adult books. This worries me, and makes me wonder if I&#x2019;m going to grow out of everything and have nothing to read except Proust. Fortunately, when and if that day comes, in several hundred years, Proust will be there, and still pristine.) <br>A re-read is more leisurely than a first read. I know the plot, after all, I know what happens. I may still cry (embarrassingly, on the train) when re-reading, but I won&#x2019;t be surprised. Because I know what&#x2019;s coming, because I&#x2019;m familiar with the characters and the world of the story, I have more time to pay attention to them. I can immerse myself in details and connections I rushed past the first time and delight in how they are put together. I can relax into the book. I can trust it completely. I really like that. <br>Very occasionally, with a wonderfully dense and complex book I&#x2019;ll re-read it right away as soon as I&#x2019;ve finished it, not just because I don&#x2019;t want to leave the world of that book but also because I know I have gulped where I should have savoured, and now that I know I can rely on the journey that is the book, I want to relax and let it take me on it. The only thing missing is the shock of coming at something unexpected and perfect around a blind corner, which can be one of the most intense pleasures of reading, but that&#x2019;s a rare pleasure anyway. Re-reading too extensively can be a bad sign for me, a sign of being down. Mixing new possibilities with reliable old ones is good, leaning on the re-reads and not adventuring anything new at all isn&#x2019;t. Besides, if I do that, where will the re-reads of tomorrow come from? I can&#x2019;t re-read the same 365 books for the next 800 years. I&#x2019;ve already read some dearly beloved books to the point where I know them by heart. <br>Long before I am 800 I will have memorized all the books I love now and be unable to re-read them, but fortunately by then people and aliens will have written plenty more new favourites, and I&#x2019;ll be re-reading them too. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright ï¿½ 2014 by Jo Walton</p><h2>Tate Modern Artists: Olafur Eliasson (Modern Artists Series)</h2><p>The Modern Artists Series from Tate Publishing focuses on living artists. Generously illustrated, accessible, and affordable, these are essential references for those interested in contemporary visual culture. See abramsbooks.com for the complete list.<p></p> Olafur Eliasson (b. 1967) pushes the boundaries of space using materials such as lights, mirrors, and water in conjunction with architectural and landscape settings. The result is some of the most ambitious and immersive contemporary art in the world, including The Weather Project, commissioned for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern in 2003, which used hundreds of yellow lamps and enormous mirrors to create a dazzling sunset and reflections of viewers and the surroundings. Drawing on a wealth of references ranging from nature to science, and using a wide variety of media, including photographs, installations, outdoor projects, videos, films, architecture, and design collaborations, his artistic output is remarkable for its breadth and diversity. This eye-opening addition to the Tate Modern Artists series features new interviews with the artist and over 100 color illustrations.<p></p></p><p><b>Marcella Beccaria </b>is curator at the Castello di Rivoli Museum of Contemporary Art in Turin.<b><p></p></b>&#39;Tate&#39;s excellent compact series on contemporary art&#39; - Financial Times</p><h2>Los Gatos Black on Halloween</h2><p><p><b>Follow los monstruos and los esqueletos to the Halloween party</b> </p><p>Under October's <i>luna</i>, full and bright, the monsters are throwing a ball in the Haunted Hall. <i>Las brujas</i> come on their broomsticks. <i>Los muertos</i> rise from their coffins to join in the fun. <i>Los esqueletos</i> rattle their bones as they dance through the door.

The full-bleed paintings create a creepy mood with curving lines, fluid textures, and dusky hues. Rounded figures dance across the atmospheric spreads, which depict blank-faced skeletons, a toothy werewolf, and a child zombie with glowing eyes. The pictures are eerie enough to tingle spines, but the effect is leavened with bits of humor (witches perform skateboard tricks on their brooms, a vampire admires himself in a mirror that reflects only his clothing). The poems cadenced rhymes and descriptive language build suspense until the satisfying ending. Spanish words are easy to understand in context, but are also defined in a glossary with pronunciation guides. This book is just right for children who are beginning to find typical Halloween fare a bit too tame.<i>&#x2013;Joy Fleishhacker,</i> School Library Journal <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During his long and productive career, this Danish-born visionary worked for and with some of the country's most prominent citizens and architects, including Henry Ford, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright. He became internationally renowned for his design of landscapes throughout the Midwest and beyond, his contributions to the American conservation movement, and his philosophy that emphasized the significance of nature in people's lives. He found inspiration in the landscape, particularly the plants native to a region, and was an environmentalist long before the term became popular.</p><p>Today, Jensen is perhaps best remembered for establishing The Clearing on Wisconsin's Door County Peninsula. But the outspoken views in his writings&#x2014;many of which were included in ephemeral planning reports, early newspapers, and out-of-print journals&#x2014;are now virtually forgotten, with the exception of his two small books.<i> Jens Jensen: Writings Inspired by Nature </i>is a collection of Jensen's most significant yet lesser-known articles.

Tishler is the author of more than 170 publications.

He performed his military service in Morocco. An early association with the Surrealists ended in 1929, and after completing a scholarly study of literary madmen of the nineteenth century for which he was unable to find a publisher, Queneau turned to fiction, writing his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Le Chiendent</i>&nbsp;(published as Witch Grass by NYRB Classics), in Greece in the summer of 1932. Influenced by James Joyce and Lewis Carroll, Queneau sought to reinvigorate French literature, grown feeble through formalism, with a strong dose of language as really spoken. He further encouraged innovation by founding, with the mathematician Franï¿½ois Le Lionnais, the famous group OULIPO (Ouvroir de Littï¿½rature Potentielle), which investigated literary composition based on the application of strict formal or mathematical procedures (members of the group included Italo Calvino, Georges Perec, and Harry Mathews). Queneau&#x2019;s many books, which typically blur the boundaries between fiction, poetry, and the essay, include&nbsp;<i>Pierrot mon ami, The Sunday of Life, Zazie in the Metro</i>&nbsp;(made into a movie by Louis Malle), and&nbsp;<i>Exercises in Style</i>; under the name of Sally Mara, he published&nbsp;<i>We Always Treat Women Too Well,</i>&nbsp;a brilliant comic spoof on the excesses of smutty popular novels. Queneau was the editor of the&nbsp;<i>Encyclopï¿½die de la Plï¿½iade</i>&nbsp;as well as a fine poet, whose lyric &#x201c;Si tu t&#x2019;imagines&#x201d; was a hit for the celebrated postwar chanteuse Juliette Grï¿½co.<br><br><b>Barbara Wright</b> is one of the premier English translators of modern French literature.

Tabin was the high-achieving bad boy of Harvard Medical School, an accomplished mountain climber and adrenaline junkie as brilliant as he was unconventional. Ruit grew up in a remote Nepalese village, where he became intimately acquainted with the human costs of inadequate access to health care. Together they found their life&#x2019;s calling: tending to the afflicted people of the Himalayas, a vast mountainous region with an alarmingly high incidence of cataract blindness.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Second Suns</i> takes us from improvised plywood operating tables in villages without electricity or plumbing to state-of-the-art surgical centers at major American universities where these two driven men are restoring sight&#x2014;and hope&#x2014;to patients from around the world. With their revolutionary, inexpensive style of surgery, Tabin and Ruit have been able to cure tens of thousands&#x2014;all for about twenty dollars per operation. David Oliver Relin brings the doctors&#x2019; work to vivid life through poignant portraits of patients helped by the surgery, from old men who cannot walk treacherous mountain trails unaided to cataract-stricken children who have not seen their mothers&#x2019; faces for years.

Become a lamp unto yourself. &#x2014;from the last teaching of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha<br><br>There is the Nepal of myth, the ice-and-rock realm of Mount Everest, the roof of the world. Then there is the country where most Nepalese actually live. I was still unfamiliar with that other, more earthly, Nepal when I first came to the Khumbu.<br><br>I had hiked up to the village of Thame, at twelve thousand feet, with Apa Sherpa. He stood a wiry five foot three and weighed perhaps 120 pounds. Apa&#x2019;s hair was cropped close, and his head was a thing of beauty&#x2014;smooth and sun-browned like an exotic nut. Looking at him, you&#x2019;d never guess he was one of the world&#x2019;s greatest athletes. But by the age of fifty, Apa had climbed to the top of Everest twenty times; no one had ever stood on the sharp peak of the earth&#x2019;s highest point more often.<br><br>Apa had invited me to Thame to meet his family and gather material about his career in the mountains, hoping that I would write a book about him. I was intrigued, not simply because of his high-altitude achievements but because, unlike many publicity-seeking Western mountaineers, Apa, like most Sherpas, climbed not for glory but to feed his family. He had also dedicated his most recent expeditions to raising money for the schools that surrounded the mountain his people know as Chomolungma, Goddess Mother of the World, and to raising awareness of the toll that global warming was taking on the Khumbu&#x2019;s receding glaciers.<br><br>By the time I arrived, the five-room school Sir Edmund Hillary had built in Apa&#x2019;s village was planning to lay off two of its teachers because of funding shortages, which would force the older students to walk six hours each day if they wanted to continue attending classes. And the lower portion of Thame had recently been washed away when a lake of glacial meltwater overran its rim and thundered through the valley where Apa had been raised. His family&#x2019;s home had been spared. So had the house next door, which belonged to the family of Tenzing Norgay, the first person to step onto the summit of Everest, alongside Hillary, in 1953.<br><br>Apa Sherpa had taken advantage of his prominence as a mountaineer to move his family from Nepal to suburban Salt Lake City, where his three children could count on a quality education. But his American dream hadn&#x2019;t panned out as he&#x2019;d expected; Apa&#x2019;s attempt to create a line of outdoor clothing had crash-landed shortly after its launch. When he emailed me to introduce himself, he was working in a metal shop, stamping out road signs for Utah&#x2019;s highways. Apa wasn&#x2019;t bitter. He described his achievements on Everest with such matter-of-fact modesty that I agreed to accompany him to Nepal on his next expedition.<br><br>As the stone and ice immensities of the Himalaya thrust into view around every twist in the trail, Apa led me over swaying suspension bridges and up steep rock staircases with effortless grace. And as we traveled together, he proved to be one of the kindest people I&#x2019;d ever met. Whenever my breathing became ragged, he&#x2019;d put a hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;Slowly, slowly,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, guiding me to a seat on the nearest stone wall or to a bench at a tea house, where he&#x2019;d pretend that he, too, was anxious to rest.<br><br>At altitude, the air was beautifully crisp, the peaks fairy-tale white. The sky draped over the low stone homes of Thame was the unblemished blue of tourist brochures. Each morning I&#x2019;d wake to the gentle alarm of yak bells. Cocooned in my warm sleeping bag, I&#x2019;d open my eyes, peer through puffs of my breath, and watch wood smoke from breakfast fires drift across low stone walls that divided pastures from potato fields. On one side, shaggy black pack animals foraged for grass shoots with delicate lips. On the other, slender plants angled toward the sun, pale green with new growth.<br><br>I interviewed Apa&#x2019;s elderly mother as she spun her prayer wheel and kept my tin mug of butter tea topped up. I also spoke with Apa&#x2019;s climbing partners, brothers, aunts, uncles, and cousins. I was so enchanted by Thame that I lingered there for several days, resisting the conclusion that was becoming as clear to me as the air above the village: that writing a book about a man climbing the same mountain twenty times, even the world&#x2019;s highest mountain, even for admirable reasons, was not something I could do well.<br><br>Apa was preparing for another attempt on Everest, and though I protested that I could find my way back down the trail to the airstrip at Lukla, where I planned to catch a small plane to Kathmandu, he insisted on accompanying me for the three-day trek. His middle-aged sister-in-law served as our porter, carrying, by a strap balanced across her broad forehead, the expedition bag I could barely lift. And with each step closer to the world of cities, with each foot of altitude lost, I felt more acutely how lucky I had been to get a glimpse into the life of this gentle man, and how much I regretted failing him.<br><br>Apa left me at Lukla. I promised that when he returned from Everest, we&#x2019;d hold a fund-raiser together for the Thame School, which we managed to do a few months later. And I delayed telling him about my pessimistic view of the book&#x2019;s future. I didn&#x2019;t want him carrying that disappointment on his way back to the top of the world.<br><br>I spent a day sitting on a foggy airstrip, feeling like I&#x2019;d been cast out of a kind of paradise, waiting for a window to open in the weather so a Yeti Airlines propeller plane could land. Dreadlocked European trekkers lounged against their backpacks, smoking hash or playing hacky sack on the empty runway, killing the hours. Sheets of fog blew by like possibilities, blanketing all of us in gloom, or opening narrow boreholes that revealed the snowfields of the high peaks, hinting at and then denying the splendor that surrounded us. The runway tilted steeply downhill, and everything felt out of balance. Though I was looking up, whenever I got a glimpse of clear sky I felt I was staring down into the ice-blue depths of a glacier.<br><br>The sight of those mountains made me think of a promise I&#x2019;d made to another climber.<br><br>I&#x2019;d met Dr. Geoffrey Tabin late one night the previous winter, in Utah. He approached me in the ballroom of the Cliff Lodge, at the Snowbird ski resort, after I&#x2019;d given a lecture. Tabin waited until the crowd thinned out. Then he pounced. He told me about his considerable achievements as a climber, which included scaling the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent. Before inviting me to dinner the following evening, he spoke of his current passion, working with a Nepalese surgeon named Sanduk Ruit to cure blindness in the developing world. Tabin was as tenacious and outgoing as Apa was modest and reserved. I agreed to join him for a meal only because he made it nearly impossible to say no.<br><br>We met for Mexican food the next night in Salt Lake City, where Tabin works, when he isn&#x2019;t overseas, as director of the International Ophthalmology Division at the University of Utah&#x2019;s Moran Eye Center. Or, rather, I watched as the bundle of nervous energy that is Geoff Tabin ticked in his seat like a time bomb and told implausible stories that turned out to be true&#x2014;he really had been part of a group of adrenaline addicts at Oxford University who invented bungee jumping&#x2014;while inhaling all his food and half of mine.<br><br>&#x201c;A lot of climbers get all weird and competitive,&#x201d; Tabin said, his voice high-pitched, his cheeks bulging with carne asada. &#x201c;I try to take the golden retriever approach to life. Try to be friendly to everyone. You get more done that way.&#x201d; I could see, even then, that he was more terrier than retriever. Tabin is compact, thickly muscled, and has a habit, once he gets something in his teeth, of not letting go. We spoke of my upcoming trip to Nepal with Apa, and he urged me to look in on his partner in Kathmandu if I had a few hours free. He said proudly that Tilganga, the eye hospital Dr. Ruit had built, was the finest medical facility in Nepal, an assembly line turning out minor miracles of healing. He assured me I&#x2019;d find Ruit fascinating, if a little intimidating. Tabin&#x2019;s enthusiasm was infectious, but I couldn&#x2019;t escape the sensation that I was becoming lodged in the terrier&#x2019;s teeth.<br><br>On the airstrip, I waited seven hours with no sign of an arriving plane. Lukla is one of the world&#x2019;s most dangerous airports, and closures can last for days. Six months after I left, in similar weather, a Yeti Airlines Twin Otter crash-landed just short of the runway, killing two crew members and all sixteen passengers. Toward dusk, I was losing hope when a chartered helicopter touched down to pick up United Nations staff, and I was able to buy my way onboard.<br><br>We flew low, beneath the clouds, tracing the contours of the land. For me, Nepal was Kathmandu and a collection of snow peaks. But as we floated slowly down toward the capital, I saw that the barren, brick-colored hills in between were densely populated. Every slope, no matter its pitch, seemed to have been stripped of trees for cooking fires and sculpted into terraced fields. I observed small figures, bent to their labors, working to draw nourishment from depleted soil. Far below, rust-colored runoff from eroded hillsides pooled like blood where it met what had once been unspoiled mountain streams, staining them with evidence of overpopulation.<br><br>With my head leaning against the helicopter&#x2019;s scuffed window, I felt deflated, as the book I&#x2019;d come halfway around the world hoping to write receded into the fog like the high peaks of the Himalaya. Dipping beneath storm clouds, we passed over the hill dwellers so closely that I could see our rotor blast ruffle their mud-spattered clothes. But they rarely looked up at us, and I had a peculiar sense of disconnection&#x2014;that the six of us gliding over their heads in our aluminum capsule were living not only in a different world but in a different century.<br><br>Sullenly, I watched the poverty of the mid-hills slide past my window. The thatched huts fastened by pillars of felled trees to denuded hilltops, the men hacking terraces from the dirt with hoes, the women carrying water up from fouled streams that trickled an hour&#x2019;s hike beneath their homes, the underfed cattle and skinny dogs&#x2014;all of it scrolled by like a documentary I didn&#x2019;t want to see. I couldn&#x2019;t know then how much of the next three years I&#x2019;d be spending in that landscape, that the brick-red soil of the mid-hills would seep into my clothing and flesh and stain the way I saw not only Nepal but the world.<br><br>The air down at four thousand feet felt hot and wet. With each breath I was aware of dense vegetal decay. Despite its powerful engine, our Land Cruiser crept along, averaging only twenty miles an hour on the road from Kathmandu to Rasuwa. The drive had looked like a simple matter on the map I&#x2019;d studied before setting out. But after hours of crawling first through maddening city traffic, then up a switchback road that climbed out of the smog-filled bowl of the Kathmandu Valley, we were still only beginning our journey, on a long, grinding descent to the Trishuli River.<br><br>Our driver, La La, and his young assistant took turns twisting every knob and dial on the dashboard. They had yet to master the operation of the air conditioner, so the windows were open to the scent of manure baking on the steep, terraced fields, and rotting plant matter where the jungle had not yet been slashed and burned. &#x201c;This vehicle is brand-new,&#x201d; La La said cheerfully. &#x201c;Only fifteen days, actually. A lot of the controls is unknown!&#x201d;<br><br>I was sitting in the backseat, next to Sanduk Ruit. Up front, Ruit&#x2019;s wife, Nanda, leaned her forearms on the windowsill, her blue sari bright against the brown hillsides. Next to her sat one of their daughters. At seventeen, Serabla clearly asserted her status as a modern, emancipated woman. She wore Levi&#x2019;s, running shoes, and a track jacket.<br><br>&#x201c;Not a bad way to travel, eh, Mommy,&#x201d; Ruit said to Nanda, who nodded dreamily. The white Land Cruiser had been a gift from a Chinese Australian donor, and Ruit was clearly delighted by it. &#x201c;When we began these remote surgical camps, we used to ride on the tops of buses with all our cases of gear, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>Each blind turn down the mountain road took me farther from the wood-fired pizza and glass of wine at an Italian restaurant I&#x2019;d been anticipating in the capital, a small reward I&#x2019;d been promising myself to dilute the taste of my failed trip to the Khumbu. But when I met Ruit, at Tilganga, he was preparing to leave immediately for a rural area, to perform free cataract surgeries, and, impulsively, he invited me along. I had no sense of Tilganga&#x2019;s merits as a hospital yet, and didn&#x2019;t have a handle on Ruit either, but Tabin had been right about at least one thing: Sanduk Ruit was intimidating. He held his large, craggy head high over his barrel chest, and a thatch of thick black hair sat on top of his scalp like a heavy woolen hat. And though he was affectionate with his wife and daughter, he spoke to me gruffly. In brief sentences. Without meeting my eyes.<br><br>Ruit was treating our conversation like an interview, so I took out my notepad and conducted one. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be operating for three days,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;With luck, we&#x2019;ll see two hundred cases.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are we going to Rasuwa?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because there are blind people there,&#x201d; Ruit said, without a trace of humor.<br><br>&#x201c;But why Rasuwa particularly?&#x201d; I asked, trying to keep the frustration from my voice.<br><br>Ruit exhaled, his eyelids lowered, indicating the effort it took to answer such an obvious question, and then he began to lecture. Rasuwa was one of the poorest regions of Nepal. The Tamang people who lived there were mostly subsistence farmers. Their lands were set unprofitably apart from the commercial center of Kathmandu, to the south, and the tourist magnet of the Khumbu, to the east. Ruit said he had conducted half a dozen free surgical camps in the area and still he was just draining an ocean of need, one teaspoon at a time. &#x201c;The Tamang of Rasuwa are the most downtrodden people on earth,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Also the most deserving.&#x201d;</p><h2>Classic English Interiors</h2><p>Classic English Interiors is a sumptuous showcase for a distinctive style that is now as popular in Manhattan as in the country houses of England.<br><br>Written by The Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, the book is divided into two parts.

At the novel's climax, readers discover that Renfield, under restraint in the asylum of Dr. John Seward, has been in psychic communication with Dracula all along, acting as his eyes and ears in expectation of unspeakable rewards. <br> Now, in an ingenious work of fiction, author Tim Lucas at last brings Renfield's own story to light. <i>The Book of Renfield</i> is a collection of the long-lost private diaries, professional journals, and wax-cylinder recordings that comprise Dr. Seward's obsessive study of Renfield. Featuring appearances by many of the characters from the original <i>Dracula,</i> Lucas's novel takes on the frighteningly realistic tone of a textual documentary as it illuminates the warped consciousness of Renfield and reveals, through a series of stories from his childhood, how this poor unfortunate was predisposed to become the ideal portal for evil.</p><p><b>Tim Lucas</b> is the author of the acclaimed novel <i>Throat Sprockets</i> and the mammoth critical biography <i>Mario Bava -- All the Colors of the Dark.</i> The editor and copublisher of <i>Video Watchdog,</i> the award-winning monthly review of fantastic cinema, he lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.<b>Chapter One: Dr. Seward's Diary.</b> <p> <i>21 March 1885.</i> -- I was apprehensive about attending to-night's dinner party at the home of Lord and Lady Remington, but one does not reject such an invitation out of hand. After much trepidation (doubtless brought on by over-work) and cajoling by Art, I made up my mind to attend -- if only for a short time. </p><p> The evening began much as I expected, as I found myself standing with Art and our host in the company of some other men of their social station, who were discussing the usual rot: business, politics, the colonisation of West Africa -- subjects which hold not the slightest interest for me. Such conversations, which one gets trapped into simply by virtue of one's sex, are one reason why I have long since ceased to look forward to such gatherings as doorways to opportunity and adventure, yet this is precisely what the evening became. </p><p> As it happens, my seating assignment at the dinner table placed me next to Mrs. Lillian Westenra, a convivial, dove-like woman whose eyes sparkled with intrigue as I was introduced to her as the founder and chief superintendent of Carfax Asylum. Many are the women who would turn to their other nearest dining companion by reflex, at the mere mention of an asylum, but Mrs. Westenra was refreshingly curious and open-minded, asking about my work with interest and sensitivity. Not once did her fascination abate long enough for me to balance our conversation with polite enquiries about herself, nor did she try to coax "colourful" gossip from me about my most tragic patients. As a result, a delicious meal went down very well, and with a slight immoderation of red wine. </p><p> As I rose to join the other gentlemen in attendance for the usual amenities in Lord Remington's spacious den, Mrs. Westenra gently took me by the arm and guided me to an adjoining room, where I was introduced to her charming daughter Lucy, who had been seated elsewhere at table, unbeknownst to me, in conversation with Art. The poor fellow was himself dragged away to the smoking room, but the combined charms of Mrs. Westenra and her daughter persuaded me to forgo my brandy and cigar in favour of their continued good company. </p><p> In the course of our conversation, we discovered many acquaintances in common and Mrs. Westenra began to speak of me to her daughter with an enthusiasm I might have found embarrassing in any other circumstance. However, the more glances I stole at this young woman, I felt a peculiar gratitude at receiving such endorsements of my good works and character. Miss Westenra listened with a most becoming placidity and sly humour; it was my observation that the natural and quite charming effusiveness of Mrs. Westenra has taken a good deal of demonstrativeness out of her daughter. Miss Westenra spoke very little when her mother was near, but once her mother excused herself to converse with our hostess, the daughter's manner transformed, blooming in a most beguiling way. </p><p> From the moment we two were first left alone in facing chairs in a corner of the drawing room, Miss Westenra became more forthcoming. </p><p> "Tell me, do you <i>always</i> look at young women that way, Doctor Seward?" she enquired with a wry smile. </p><p> "And which way is that, Miss Westenra?" </p><p> "You have been looking at me with an expression of great resolution. Your gaze has been most direct." </p><p> I felt quite disarmed. "Please accept my apologies," I stammered. "To be perfectly candid, I have been working much too hard of late, and I'm so accustomed to speaking only to my patients, probing their faces for answers to questions they cannot or will not articulate...Well, I am well to be reminded that not everyone I meet is a riddle to be solved." </p><p> "Oh, I'll bet you couldn't solve the riddle of a face like mine," she challenged. </p><p> A woman takes a terrible risk when inviting a man to drink as deeply of her beauty as he dares -- and a man dares to risk all, should he accept. Indeed, Miss Lucy Westenra presented to me a most inscrutable face. She has a sweet, bubbly character and a vivacious hauteur that is at once knowing and yet utterly naï¿½ve. This combination of opposites has the uncanny effect of making her look as candid as she is mysterious. This is a conundrum that would take even a husband a lifetime of happy effort to solve -- but foolishly, I accepted her dare. </p><p> It was rather like the blinking contest which children play. She presented her face to me, and I leaned forward, granted permission to peer as deep as I dare through the windows of her soul. What I beheld there made me jittery in its unflinching candour, and I began to finger the lancet chain -- I believe that's what it's called -- that secures my grandfather's pocket watch to the fob pocket of my waistcoat, to steady my nerves. Several moments passed in which the room and world around us ceased to exist. </p><p> One of us had to bow to the other first, and Miss Westenra wasn't about to give me the satisfaction of flinching, so finally I did the gallant thing and broke our silence. </p><p> "You afford me a most curious psychological study, Miss Westenra," was my unfortunate choice of words. </p><p> She giggled and shot back, "Oh, I should be quite certain of that, Doctor Seward!" (Would she have spoken so provocatively had she not intended to encourage me, wished me to remember her?) </p><p> With this episode in mind, I am retiring early in full expectation of pleasant dreams. </p><p> <i>22 March.</i> -- My first thoughts as I rose this morning were of last evening. Must focus on work. </p><p> <i>29 March.</i> -- As if in answer to my prayers for something to occupy me, this has proved a most eventful Saturday evening -- Sunday morning, rather! </p><p> A new patient has been installed here at the asylum, quite a bizarre and interesting case. He was brought to our care by two police constables who chanced to spy, in the light of the Moon, his shadow moving about in the rubble of the Carfax estate. This festering property, formerly an abbey, has long been for sale, but no one will go near it. There is something foreboding and worrisome, almost supernaturally so, about a holy place that has fallen to ruin. It stands there in the midst of our street like the Devil's triumph. </p><p> Approaching the vagrant stealthfully from behind, the constables initially thought he must be deep in prayer, as he was kneeling and in a bowing posture, but as one of them signalled their presence by stumbling over a stray bottle, he whipped around to face them and they saw his mouth bespattered with fresh, wet blood. </p><p> Hanging from his hands were the limp remains of a rat -- its abdomen scooped out by a single bite. The constables, perhaps weakened by their revulsion, found the man's resistance unexpectedly strong. They said it was not their counter-action of strength that finally subdued him, but rather that the remains of the rodent slipped from his hands during their struggle, which broke his concentration. To be separated from this unspeakable rag of hair and flesh seemed to bring him the most unbearable, inconsolable sorrow. He pleaded with the constables for the carcass, promising them his co-operation, but when it was denied him, he shrieked, "Give it back to me! It was promised me! It is <i>mine!"</i> </p><p> The constables assumed him to be one of my patients, gone over the wall, and they brought him here. They turned him over to the strong arms of my ready attendants, but even they could control his violence only with the greatest difficulty -- and these are big, burly men! Soon enough he was packed into a strait-waistcoat, which made him easier to manage. My initial impression was that this hellion should be assigned one of our isolated cells below-stairs, if not the padded one. However, as we were guiding him in that general direction, the fellow happened to catch sight of an open room on our main floor whose window looked out upon the ruins where he was apprehended. I was standing in a position to see what he saw; the abbey was like a black moonscape whose pock marks were stencilled against a blue-black sky. It is a regrettable view, unwholesome and hardly a tonic for the morbid of mind, which is why that particular room was un-occupied. But as we passed that open door, his behaviour changed so dramatically that we all took notice. He was becalmed like the sea after a great storm, so suddenly that the attendants later told me they thought it might be a trick to get them to loosen their grips, that he might scurry away. To me, his transformation seemed to be perfectly sincere. </p><p> "No, here!" he exclaimed. "I must stay here!" He looked inside the un-occupied room with all the joy and surprise of a child looking into a room where a birthday cake with all its burning candles awaits. He turned to me, sensing that I was in charge, and showed me the more reasonable and conciliatory sides of his nature. <i>"Please, Doctor,"</i> he begged, hissing slightly through teeth still stained with the disgusting remnants of his last meal. "I beg you -- I beseech you -- I promise you, sir, that your kind indulgence will be greatly rewarded!" </p><p> It was a bit over-done, but his very peace of mind seemed to depend on this accommodation, so I granted his wish -- on the condition that he remain chained to the wall nearest the room's cot, in his strait-waistcoat, throughout the initial observation period of twenty-four hours. </p><p> As he was being introduced to his quarters, I stood by to take stock of our new resident. He is a husky, middle-aged man, pear-shaped though not quite stout, with a great mop of unkempt grey hair on his head, tiny white hairs sprouting along the edges of his fleshy ears. He wears narrow spectacles, which were not broken, despite the scuffle. These may offer a clue to his past as they are the kind worn by people associated with close -- perhaps clerical -- work; they were not very clean, and he looks over the top of them more than through them. He is a nail-biter, but so meticulous in this fixation that his attentions rather improved the look of his stubby, dirty hands, which are dimpled along the knuckle line like a child's. He was given to my care in a s...</p></p><h2>The Dragon Isles: Crossroads</h2><p>The Dragon Isles: abandoned home of the good dragons, land of amazing adventure and legendary treasure.

He's aware that some Stephen King first editions can bring more money than most Mark Twain firsts, and a copy of Raymond Chandler's <i>Lady in the Lake</i> is worth more than $1,000. And he realizes that, contrary to popular belief, "older" doesn't necessarily mean "more valuable." <br> He also knows that valuable volumes can be hidden in plain view among otherwise ordinary book collections. It's not easy to find such books, but some people seem to have an extraordinary talent for honing in on the treasures. <br> Such a man is bookscout Bobby Westfall. Bobby once earned $900 in a single weekend and has generally spotted enough valuable books to keep himself and his beloved cats fed and housed. <br> Now Bobby is dead, murdered at the witching hour on Friday the thirteenth, his body dumped under a ladder in a dark alley. It's not a good end for a superstitious man. Janeway is sure he knows who did it. But can he catch him? And, in the process, will Janeway's own life change forever? <br> <b><i>THE BOOKMAN'S WAKE</i></b> <br> The story starts and ends, aptly, with a very special book: a 1969 edition of Edgar Allan Poe's <i>The Raven,</i> published by the tiny, prestigious Grayson Press of North Bend, Washington. The Grayson bibliography mentions no such edition. If, indeed, it exists, it could be worth a fortune to the right collector. It's the kind of book somebody might kill for. In fact, somebody probably already has. <br> Ex-Denver cop Janeway is happily at work selling rare and used books when former police colleague Clydell Slater arrives with an offer. Slater runs a detective agency and he wants Janeway to go to Seattle to pick up a young female fugitive and deliver her to Taos, New Mexico. The woman is wanted for burglary and assault. More to the point, as far as Janeway's concerned, she may also have in her possession a stolen copy of the 1969 Grayson Press <i>Raven,</i> taken when she ransacked a Taos home. <br> The rare-book angle gets to Janeway every time. He could turn down thousands of dollars in fees, but he can't say no to <i>The Raven.</i> <br> Janeway signs on to the case because of a book, but he stays because of a vulnerable young woman. He will discover not only her painful story but the poignant tale of a once-great small press, where paper and ink became beautiful books in the hands of a master craftsman.</p><p>John Dunning has revealed some of book collecting&#x2019;s most shocking secrets in his bestselling series of crime novels featuring Cliff Janeway: <i>Booked to Die</i>, which won the prestigious Nero Wolfe award; <i>The Bookman&#x2019;s Wake</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book; and the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Bookman&#x2019;s Promise</i>, <i>The Sign of the Book</i>, and <i>The Bookwoman&#x2019;s Last Fling</i>.

I had just finished a thirteen-hour shift, my fourth day running of heavy overtime, and I hadn't been sleeping well until tonight. A guy named Jackie Newton was haunting my dreams. He was my enemy and I thought that someday I would probably have to kill him. When the bell went off, I was dreaming about Jackie Newton and our final showdown. For some reason -- logic is never the strong point of a dream like that -- Jackie and I were in the hallway at East High School. The bell brought the kids out for the change of classes; Jackie started shooting and the kids began to drop, and that bell kept ringing as if it couldn't stop.<br><br>In the bed beside me, Carol stirred.<br><br>"Oh, Cliff," she groaned. "Would somebody please get that goddamn telephone?"<br><br>I groped for the night table, felt the phone, and knocked the damn thing to the floor. From some distant galaxy I could hear the midget voice of Neal Hennessey, saying, "Cliff?...Cliff?...Hey, Clifford!" I reached along the black floor and found the phone, but it was still many seconds later before Hennessey took on his bearlike image in my mind.<br><br>"Looks like we got another one," Hennessey said without preamble.<br><br>I struggled to sit up, trying to get used to the idea that Jackie Newton hadn't shot me after all.<br><br>"Hey, Cliffie...you alive yet?"<br><br>"Yeah, Neal, sure. First time I been sound asleep in a week."<br><br>He didn't apologize; he just waited.<br><br>"Where you at?" I said.<br><br>"Alley off Fifteenth, just up from the <i>Denver Post.</i> This one looks an awful lot like the others."<br><br>"Give me about half an hour."<br><br>"We'll be here."<br><br>I sat for another minute, then I got up and went into the bathroom. I turned on the light and looked in the mirror and got the first terrifying look at myself in the cold hard light of the new day. You're getting old, Janeway, I thought. Old Andrew Wyeth could make a masterpiece out of a face like that. Call it <i>Clifford Liberty Janeway at thirty-six, with no blemish eliminated and no character line unexplored.</i><br><br>I splashed cold water on my face: it had a great deal less character after that. To finally answer Hennessey, yes, I was almost alive again. The vision of Jackie Newton rose up before me and my hand went automatically to the white splash of scar tissue just under my right shoulder. A bank robber had shot me there five years ago. I knew Jackie Newton would give a lot to put in another one, about three inches to the left and an inch or so down.<br><br><i>Man with an old bullet wound,</i> by Wyeth: an atypical work, definitely not your garden-variety Helga picture.<br><br>When I came out of the bathroom Carol was up. She had boiled water and had a cup of instant coffee steaming on my nightstand.<br><br>"What now?" she said.<br><br>As I struggled into my clothes, I told her it looked like another derelict murder. She sighed loudly and sat on the bed.<br><br>She was lovely even in a semistupor. She had long auburn hair and could probably double for Helga in a pinch. No one but Wyeth would know.<br><br>"Would you like me to come with you?"<br><br>I gave a little laugh, blowing the steam from my coffee.<br><br>"Call it moral support," she said. "Just for the ride down and back. Nobody needs to see me. I could stay in the car."<br><br>"Somebody would see you, all right, and then the tongues would start. It'd be all over the department by tomorrow."<br><br>"You know something? I don't even care."<br><br>"I care. What we do in our own time is nobody's business."<br><br>I went to the closet and opened it. Our clothes hung there side by side -- the blue uniform Carol had worn on yesterday's shift; my dark sport coat; our guns, which had become as much a part of the wardrobe as pants, shirts, ties, badges. I never went anywhere without mine, not even to the corner store. I had had a long career for a guy thirty-six: I'd made my share of enemies, and Jackie Newton was only the latest.<br><br>I put the gun on under my coat. I didn't wear a tie, wasn't about to at that time of night. I was off duty and I'd just been roused from a sound sleep; I wasn't running for city council, and I hated neckties.<br><br>"I know you've been saying that for a long time now, that stuff about privacy," Carol said dreamily. "But I think the real reason is, if people know about me, I make you vulnerable."<br><br>I didn't want to get into it. It was just too early for a philosophical discourse. There was something in what Carol said, but something in what I said too. I've never liked office gossip, and I didn't want people talking about her and me.<br><br>But Carol had been looking at it from another angle lately. We had been seeing each other, in the polite vernacular, for a year now, and she was starting to want something more permanent. Maybe bringing our arrangement into the public eye would show me how little there was to worry about. People did it all the time. For most of them the world didn't come to an end. Occasionally something good came out of it.<br><br>So she thought.<br><br>"I'm going back to bed," she said. "Wake me when you come in. Maybe I'll have a nice surprise for you."<br><br>She lay back and closed her eyes. Her hair made a spectacular sunburst on the pillow. I sat for a while longer, sipping my coffee. There wasn't any hurry: a crime lab can take three hours at the scene. I'd leave in five minutes and still be well within the half hour I'd promised Hennessey. The trouble is, when I have dead time -- even five minutes unfilled in the middle of the night -- I begin to think. I think about Carol and me and all the days to come. I think about the job and all the burned-out gone-forever days behind us. I think about quitting and I wonder what I'd do. I think about being tied to someone and anchoring those ties with children.<br><br>Carol would not be a bad one to do that with. She's pretty and bright, and maybe this is what love is. She's good company: her interests broaden almost every day. She reads three books to my one, and I read a lot. We talk far into the night. She still doesn't understand the first edition game: Hemingway, she says, reads just as well in a two-bit paperback as he does in a $500 first printing. I can still hear myself lecturing her the first time she said that. Only a fool would read a first edition. Simply having such a book makes life in general and Hemingway in particular go better when you do break out the reading copies. I listened to myself and thought, This woman must think I'm a government-inspected horse's ass. Then I showed her my Faulkners, one with a signature, and I saw her shiver with an almost sexual pleasure as she touched the paper where he'd signed it. Faulkner was her most recent god, and I had managed to put together a small but respectable collection of his first editions. You've got to read this stuff, she said to me when she was a month deep in his work. How can you collect the man without ever reading what he's written? In fact, I had read him, years ago: I never could get the viewpoints straight in <i>The Sound and the Fury,</i> but I had sense enough at sixteen to know that the problem wasn't with Faulkner but with me. I was trying to work up the courage to tackle him again: if I began to collect him, I reasoned, I'd have to read him sooner or later. Carol shook her head. Look at it this way, I said, the Faulkners have appreciated about twenty percent in the three years I've owned them. That she understood.<br><br>My apartment looked like an adjunct of the Denver Public Library. There were wall-to-wall books in every room. Carol had never asked the Big Dumb Question that people always ask when they come into a place like this: <i>Jeez, d'ya read all these?</i> She browsed, fascinated. The books have a loose logic to their shelving: mysteries in the bedroom; novels out here; art books, notably by the Wyeths, on the far wall. There's no discrimination -- they are all first editions -- and when people try to go highbrow on me, I love reminding them that my as-new copy of Raymond Chandler's <i>Lady in the Lake</i> is worth a cool $1,000 today, more than a bale of books by most of the critically acclaimed and already forgotten so-called masters of the art-and-beauty school. There's nothing wrong with writing detective stories if you do it well enough.<br><br>I've been collecting books for a long time. Once I killed two men in the same day, and this room had an almost immediate healing effect.<br><br>I've missed my calling, I thought. But now was probably years too late to be thinking about it.<br><br>Time to go.<br><br>"Cliff?"<br><br>Her eyes were still closed, but she was not quite asleep.<br><br>"I'm leaving now," I said.<br><br>"You going out to see Jackie Newton?"<br><br>"If this is what it looks like, you better believe it."<br><br>"Have Neal watch your flank. And both of you be careful."<br><br>I went over and kissed her on the temple. Two minutes later I was in my car, gliding through the cool Denver night.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 1992 by John Dunning</p><h2>Forgotten Armies: Britain&#39;s Asian Empire and the War with Japan</h2><p>The vast crescent of British-ruled territories from India down to Singapore appeared in the early stages of the Second World War a massive asset in the war with Germany, providing huge quantities of soldiers and raw materials and key part of an impregnable global network denied to the Nazis. Within a few weeks in 1941-2 a Japanese invasion had destroyed all this, almost effortlessly taking the &#39;impregnable fortress&#39; of Singapore with its 80,000 strong garrison, and sweeping through South and Southeast Asia to the frontier of India itself. This revolutionary, absolutely gripping book brings to life the entire experience of South and Southeast Asia in this extraordinary period, telling the story from an Indian, Burmese, Chinese or Malay perspective as much as from that of the British or Japanese. Effectively it is the story of the birth of modern South and Southeast Asia and the hopes and fears of the dozens of &#39;forgotten armies&#39; marching through the jungle battlefields, so many dying for causes swept away by the reality that emerged in 1945. Even as the British successfully fought back in the bloodiest battles in South and Southeast Asia&#39;s history, there was no going back to colonial rule.</p><p>Christopher Bayly is Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History, University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St Catharine&#39;s College, Cambridge.

Now, in the dying days of winter&#x2019;s Second Thaw, the warmth promised by a coming spring had caused trees of all heights to bud with new leaves, casting ever-changing patterns of shadow on the mossy ground below.</p> <p>Melisande Navarne, mere days from her tenth birthday, reined her horse to a stop beneath those entwined branches, watching the patterns of light and shadow dance all around her.</p> <p>And listened.</p> <p>The air of the forest, rich and heavy with life and the lingering scent of old magic, was both sweet and spicy to her nose. The dazzling dance of the sun on the leaves filled her eyes, making her yearn for more innocent times, when she could have taken off her boots and run through the greenwood, playing chase with her brother and the father she had loved to adoration. The sweet singing of birds in the trees delighted her ears, completing the picture of tranquillity of an ancient forest in the advent of spring.</p> <p>Except that in this place, if things were as they should be, no birds should sing.</p> <p>All around them the woods were alive with natural music, the rustling of trees&#x2019; boughs, skittering and snapping in the undergrowth, and everywhere birdsong, a wild, almost nervous cacophony. The clear water of the stream she had been following joined in the forest song, splashing noisily as it hurried ahead of her. Melisande glanced repeatedly over her shoulder for Gavin the Invoker, feeling less than comforted, even at the sight of him following her, as he had promised to do. There was something looming in the distance, something she had been warned about from the beginning, but was still unprepared for, no matter how good a face she was able to put on.</p> <p>She clicked to her mount and continued into the greenwood.</p> <p>Finally, when the noise was all but deafening, she heard a soft birdcall behind her, one she had come to recognize as the Invoker&#x2019;s signal. Melisande reined her horse to a halt and looked over her shoulder again.</p> <p>Gavin had halted as well.</p> <p>&#x201c;This is where we part company for the moment, Lady Melisande Navarne,&#x201d; he said seriously, gentling his own mount. &#x201c;Your instructions from the Lady Cymrian forbid me from going on past this place.&#x201d;</p> <p>The little girl nodded, trying to appear brave, but her stomach turned to water at his words. Gavin had found her, lost and wandering aimlessly in the forest after her carriage had been attacked. In spite of his gruffness and his sparse use of words, Gavin had been a comforting presence, a staunch protector and capable guide to this place of unwelcome birdsong and the errant wind in the trees. She had grown to depend on him to keep her safe not only from the dangers that lurked in the greenwood, but from her own doubts and fears.</p> <p>It appeared both of those protections were about to come to an end.</p> <p>She glanced into the sky above her. The silver branches of the tall trees reached, twisting, into a sky racing with clouds of almost the same color. Melisande shivered, then dismounted.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you certain, Gavin?&#x201d; she asked, hating the nervousness that made her voice sound younger than she was. &#x201c;You are sure this is the place? You said you have never been here before.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Invoker smiled. It was something Melisande had rarely seen him do in their brief time together, but she knew immediately that he had seen through her attempt to keep him with her a little longer.</p> <p>&#x201c;The instructions you conveyed to me were to bring you to follow the sweetwater creek to Mirror Lake.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p> <p>Gavin nodded at the opening in the thicket before them. Melisande followed his gaze with hers, then tremulously ventured into the copse of trees. Beyond it, the splashing stream emptied out into an oval body of water, glistening in the morning light, its surface flat and smooth as a pane of glass. Mist clung to the clear water, hovering above it like clouds reflecting the sky.</p> <p><i>Don&#x2019;t be frightened.</i></p> <p>Melisande froze. The words were spoken in her ear, quiet and distinct, as if the speaker had been standing a hairsbreadth away, in the unmistakable voice of Rhapsody, the Lady Cymrian.</p> <p><i>I have a mission for you.</i></p> <p>The little girl spun around, looking anxiously for a glimpse of the Lady&#x2019;s golden hair, a shadow of her small, slender form, but there was nothing in the greenwood but the wind in the trees and the song of birds. The words could have come directly from her memory, spoken to her as they had been on a dark night, not really that long ago and a whole lifetime away. But they were not a function of memory; she could hear them as plainly as she could hear the rustling of the underbrush around her.</p> <p>She thought back to that dark night, to the room in her family&#x2019;s keep, in the fading glow of the evening&#x2019;s candles. Melisande could feel the warmth and tingling of excitement now that she had felt then when Rhapsody had taken her hands and had begun to chant softly in the words of an ancient language, taught to her more than a thousand years before by her mentor in the art of Singing, a science known to her mother&#x2019;s people, the Liringlas, called Skysingers in the common language, and Namers, when they were especially advanced in it.</p> <p>Melisande closed her eyes, reveling for a moment in the memory.</p> <p>The air in the room had gone dry as the water within it was stripped, and a thin circle of mist formed around the two of them, glittering like sunlight on morning dew. A moment later, the words Rhapsody was speaking had began to echo outside of the mist in staggered intervals, building one upon the other until the room beyond was filled with a quiet cacophony. Melisande had witnessed this phenomenon before; the Lady Cymrian, the closest thing to a mother she had known, often called such a circle of masking noise into being to protect their words from imaginary eavesdroppers whenever the two of them were whispering, giggling, and sharing secret thoughts. The corners of Melisande&#x2019;s eyes stung with sharp tears, bitter for the loss of those innocent times.</p> <p><i>I need you to do something for me that I can entrust to no one in this world other than you, Melly.</i></p> <p>The voice was even closer now, clearer in her ears. At the time they had first been spoken, the words had rung with a clarity that Melisande recognized as the Naming ability of True-Speaking. Now she wondered if, besides magically ensuring their veracity, the Lady Cymrian had been planting them in her head for this very moment, to remind her of her quest, or to indicate that she had arrived on its doorstep, in this sacred place, this untouched ground where only a handful of people had ever trod in all of history.</p> <p><i>This night I will send a messenger bird to Gavin asking him to do as you direct him when you arrive. I can only entrust this request to you in spoken word, because if something should happen to the message, it would be disastrous.</i></p> <p>Melisande, orphaned by such disasters, had understood the full implication of the Lady Cymrian&#x2019;s words.</p> <p><i>Once you arrive at the Circle, ask Gavin to take you, along with a full contingent of his top foresters and his most accomplished healer, to the greenwood north-northeast of the Tar&#x2019;afel River, where the holly grows thickest.</i></p> <p>Melisande turned slowly, scanning the distant edges of the forest, burgeoning black with that holly, and willed herself to be calm.</p> <p><i>These are sacred lands, and I can give you no map, for fear of what might become of it. Gavin will know where this is. Tell him to have his foresters fan out at that point, keeping to a distance of half a league each, and form a barrier that extends northwest all the way to the sea, setting whatever snares and traps they need to protect that barrier. They are to remain there, allowing no living soul to enter. They should comb the woods for a lost Firbolg midwife named Krinsel, and should they come upon her, they are to accord her both respect and safe passage back to the guarded caravan, which will accompany her to Ylorc.</i></p> <p>In spite of being alone, Melisande nodded at the words. All had been done according to these commands; even now, many leagues behind them, the elite of Gavin&#x2019;s corps of foresters guarded the holy forest lands, unseen in the greenwood. She began to tremble, recalling how Gavin had recently come upon the body of a woman being devoured by coyotes, and wondering if the first part of her mission had already ended in failure.</p> <p><i>Gavin himself is to take you from this point onward,</i> the voice continued. It switched ears, making her start, and she turned quickly in the new direction of the voice to find herself facing the sparkling stream. <i>A sweetwater creek flows south into the Tar&#x2019;afel; follow it northward until you come to Mirror Lake&#x2014;you will know this body of water because its name describes it perfectly.</i></p> <p><i>Yes, it does,</i> Melisande acknowledged. <i>This is the place.</i> Her stomach turned as she remembered the words that were to come a heartbeat later.</p> <p><i>At the lake you are to leave Gavin and travel on alone. He is to wait for you there for no more than three days. If you have not returned by then, direct him to return to the Circle.</i></p> <p>She stared, lost in thought, down into the glassy water of the lake, still partly frozen in winter&#x2019;s grip of ice, though the spring melt had begun, leaving large pools of shimmering liquid pocketing the surface, reflecting the sky. Melisande bent over and looked into the water.</p> <p>A stranger&#x2019;s face returned her gaze.</p> <p>The last time she had beheld her own aspect, it had been in her bedroom in her family&#x2019;s keep, and a young child of nine summers with black, inquisitive eyes ringed by golden curls had looked back at her, mischievous and smart beyond her years. The face that stared at her now was much older, though it had been but a few weeks in time since then, harder, browner.</p> <p>More determined.</p> <p>A face that had survived the attack of her carriage on the way to fulfill the quest Rhapsody had given her, the slaughter of most of her guards, and her awkward introduction to Gavin, who now seemed about to send her on her way, alone.</p> <p>How long Melisande stood, absorbing the words of the voice, contemplating the change in her face, she did not know. When a quiet coughing sound behind her startled her, she looked up to see that the sun had climbed a little higher in the sky, though the mist still clung to the water of the lake, unmoved by its ascent. She turned to see the Invoker, still atop his horse, watching her intently.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, Lady Melisande Navarne?&#x201d;</p> <p>Melisande inhaled deeply, the cold air of spring making the bottom of her lungs cramp. Then she walked back to Gavin and his mount.</p> <p>&#x201c;This is the place, you are right,&#x201d; she said, her young voice crisp with confidence she did not feel. &#x201c;I am to go on from here alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Invoker nodded, then alighted from his horse in a movement so swift she almost didn&#x2019;t see it. The golden oak leaf atop his wooden staff, the symbol of his office, caught the light as he dismounted, making it flash. It was the only thing that served to remind Melisande that she was traveling with the leader of the most numerous religious sect on the continent rather than a scruffy forester.</p> <p>&#x201c;You will be all right, then.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Invoker smiled again. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said, humor in his husky voice. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a question.&#x201d; He opened the saddlebag and pulled forth a leather pack. &#x201c;If I recall, I am to wait here for three days.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p> <p>He tossed her the pack. &#x201c;Well, this should keep you that long without getting too hungry. There is a waterskin in there as well&#x2014;best not to drink anything found in these lands unless you know it to be safe and permissible for you to do so.&#x201d;</p> <p>Melisande put her arms through the straps. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The spores you will find in a sack inside there are luminescent&#x2014;they glow in the dark when gently crushed. They should provide you light enough to see in the dark, as long as you are not too deep under the canopy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Again, thank you.&#x201d;</p> <p>The Invoker came and stood in front of her.</p> <p>&#x201c;With your permission, m&#x2019;lady, I would offer you a blessing, even though you are an adherent of the Patrician faith, rather than that of the Filidic order,&#x201d; he said. His voice took on a more gentle tone, and Melisande looked up to find his eyes fixed on her.</p> <p>&#x201c;By all means,&#x201d; she said, trying to sound older than her years.</p> <p>The corners of the Invoker&#x2019;s mouth crinkled, but his eyes remained serious.</p> <p>&#x201c;Kneel then, if you will, Lady Melisande Navarne,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>The little girl sank quickly to the mossy ground.</p> <p>Gavin pulled off his lambskin glove and rested his weathered hand on her head. He began to chant quietly in a language Melisande had not heard before, even in snippets of conversation she had caught in passing at the Circle, the central gathering place and holy lands of the Filidic religion. The dance of unintelligible words seemed after a moment to entwine with the gusts of wind around her, buffeting her with a breeze that felt warmer than it had a moment before.</p> <p>The ground, cold and wet beneath her knees, hummed with a sudden warmth, blending with the song of the wind and that of the Invoker, lulling her. <i>I&#x2019;m so tired,</i> she thought hazily, <i>so tired</i>. <i>I don&#x2019;t know if I can take another step. Let me sleep, then, let me curl up and sleep just a little longer.</i></p> <p>The newborn leaves rustled in the branches above, jarring her awake.</p> <p>Her knees, no longer cold and stinging, tingled with warmth that seemed to seep up from the ground beneath her. The warmth spread quickly through her, filling her with energy she had not felt since she left home. It shot all the way to the top of her head, where the Invoker&#x2019;s hand rested.</p> <p>She blinked, awake and alert.</p> <p>Gavin removed his hand and helped her rise. He leaned on his staff, his eyes still trained on her thoughtfully.</p> <p>&#x201c;May the stars guide you, Lady Melisande Navarne,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;May the winds cleanse all ills and remain at your back. May the earth protect you and give you strength. May fire guard you, and rain refresh you, may all nature be your friend until we meet again in this place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Melisande said. She shifted the pack on her shoulders to a more comfortable position, and patted her horse in farewell. &#x201c;Remember, only wait three days. After that, Rhapsody said you should return to the Circle.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So you have conveyed,&#x201d; Gavin replied. His eyes, dark in a face weathered brown from the sun, twinkled like starlight on dark water. &#x201c;But, as I told you when I agreed to guide you here, take heed and remember this well&#x2014;no matter what comes to pass, I will come for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Melisande tried to smile, but instead just turned to follow the stream.</p> <p>&#x201c;Three days hence, you will return, and with you, the spring,&#x201d; Gavin said from behind her. &#x201c;And then you will be ten&#x2014;life is much better when there are two digits in your age. It is even more so when there are three, but you shall have to wait awhile to see that.&#x201d; His hand came to rest on her shoulder. &#x201c;Having the first day of spring as your birthday is auspicious, Lady Melisande Navarne. It means you are one who can bring about profound change in the world, returning warm...</p></p><h2>Betty White: In Person</h2><p>Discussing everything, from friendship, love, and anger, to romance, sex, loneliness, aging, and death, the television actress shares her thoughts and experiences of life</p><p>Calling herself a dedicated "closet writer," actress White, coauthor of Betty White's Pet Love, conveys an endearing zest for life, people and nature in short, ebullient commentaries on both serious and trivial topics that denote sensitivity and the ability to laugh at herself. An ardent animal lover, she actively solicits support for zoos and conservation from her show-business friends. This book of reflections is free of professional pettiness, and she asserts that the Golden Girls actresses are as friendly off camera as on, and so were the Mary Tyler Moore cast members with whom she worked. White's pet peeves encompass sloppy diction, bathroom humor and mirrored sunglasses, and she expresses strong dislike for the blatant sex and voyeurism on today's screens and for "people who wear grief like a mantle." Her reminiscences of her parents and of her former husband, Password host Allen Luddon, are fond.

Influenced by Anders Zorn and Carl Larsson, and by the fantasy work of Arnold Bocklin, he started illustrating fairy stories whilst still a student at the Swedish Royal Academy. His best-known illustrations were for an annual Christmas book for children, Bland Tomtar och Troll (Among Elves and Trolls), which delighted readers with their gentle humour and delicate detail. Bauer died at the age of just 35 when he, his wife and their three-year-old son were drowned when a ferry they were taking to Jonkoping sank in Lake Vï¿½ttern.<p>'[John Bauer's] stylised images seem to suggest the universal ... they are extremely evocative. His use of muted tones means his rare flashes of colour... seem to illuminate his dark forest scenes with a magical glow.

Caveat emptor. This is not a pastel reverie, but a work in which the author, an English philosopher, feminist, and Marxist, not only bares her soul but carefully dissects it. It begins as autobiography: Rose describes her secular Jewish upbringing and goes on to discuss professional and personal engagements, among them an affair with a priest. She writes with equal power and precision about sex or the place of reason in a postmodern age, and when she discloses, about halfway through the book, that she has been diagnosed with a fatal cancer, she resists the temptation to make her predicament pathetic. Deploring the different ways in which both conventional and alternative medical treatments diminish the lives of the sick -- the one by what she calls its iatrogenic materialism, the other by a "Screwtape spirituality" -- Rose develops by contrast her notion of love's work: the obligation to go on thinking and caring in spite of the certainty of physical and moral defeat. Gillian Rose died shortly after completing this rigorous and lyrical book. <br><i>Copyright ï¿½ 1996, Boston Review.

I asked the proprietor to tell me something about it and he answered my inquiries with, &#x201c;That is by Paul Jacoulet, a Frenchman who lived in Tokyo and copied Japanese woodblock prints.&#x201d; I remember thinking as I held it that it could not possibly be the copy of any known ukiyo-e print, and yet the techniques involved in producing it were obviously similar to those of Edo period Japan. The strongest impression was that it was freshly conceived and not in the least bit imitative. I was, at that time, and am still, a collector of classical Japanese prints. Because of prejudices ingrained by looking at the subtle colors and superb, but for the most part, somewhat safe designs of the older prints, it is difficult to look at the works of Paul Jacoulet without being disturbed,</p><p></p><h2>Comebacks at Work: Using Conversation to Master Confrontation</h2><p><p>A stimulating, thought-provoking book that lets you know how to break free of negative behavior, take control of office politics, and prevent difficult, repetitive, and avoidable situations.

Forty-six key dates printed in large numerals on red borders introduce each section, which contains a map of the continent and a subsidiary map showing more local developments. Brief textual interpretations accompany the effective and visually appealing maps, which were prepared by the prestigious firm of Batholomew of Edinburgh. The contributors to this atlas are British academicians, among them Jeremy Black, editor of A Dictionary of Eighteenth Century World History (LJ 5/1/94); their comments are concise and elucidating.

This lively story begins at the beginning, with Francis as a very human and, therefore, flawed man, a hopeless romantic who is slowly and painfully drawn by grace toward a destiny he does not desire.<p><br>More than simply picturing the patron saint of poverty, peace, ecology and animals, this book depicts Francis as a holy model for becoming fully oneself as a unique individual. From the age of fourteen until his death, this passionate man is forced to wrestle with his opposing personalities. On the one hand he is an ascetic influenced by the negative theology of his day. On the other hand he is a poet, troubadour, and joyful lover of life.</p><p><br>If you are a fan of Ed Hays, you won't want to miss <i>The Passionate Troubadour</i>. Of his thirty books of contemporary spirituality, Hays says this is his favorite. If you're new to Hays, this is a good place to start.</p></p><p>Father Edward M. Hays is the author of more than thirty books on contemporary spirituality. He was the co-founder and moving spirit of Forest of Peace Publishing and founding director of Shantivanam, a Midwest center for contemplative prayer. He has served as a chaplain of the state penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas, parish priest, and spiritual director. Hays has spent extended periods of pilgrimage in the Near East, the Holy Land, and India and remains a prolific writer and painter.This fervent fictional biography of St. Francis of Assisi paints a full-bodied portrait of a man struggling to resolve the essentially paralyzing conflict between his ascetic spirituality and his vital humanity. Although the story of Francis, the privileged son of a wealthy merchant who renounced all his worldly possessions in favor of a life of poverty, is a familiar one, Hays takes it to a new and invigorating level, introducing a compelling cast of supporting characters who influence Francis along his often torturous and conflicted path to holiness. No plaster saint, Francis emerges as a more earthy and robust version of the retiring hermit of religious folklore and legend. Splendid historical fiction replete with authentic medieval detailing. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

I was crossing America constantly and<br>experiencing the morality shifts, attitudes, and rituals in different parts<br>of the country - the difference in the way people were in the Bible Belt as<br>opposed to New York City, the way blacks and whites interfaced, the<br>intolerance of homosexuality, the morality plays. I started to become aware<br>of how brutal the country is and how much ferocity, cruelty, and oppression<br>are inherent in the culture and how much of it was in me. I wanted to<br>document it and create a book that brought the whole thing to a boil and see w<br>here it left me off. In the summer of 1995, I finished the book and started<br>to edit. Re-reading the manuscript over and over, I realized all the things I<br>had picked up over a decade of playing Devil's advocate and it was inspiring<br>because it clearly defined who my enemies are. As an American, I feel it<br>impossible not to be infuriated by the way things are and have been. I refuse<br>to be happy about the day-to-day and go along with it. There's too much<br>spitting in my face and too much spitting in the faces of people who don't<br>know any other way of life. This book is brutal, and at times, funny. I know<br>that I will probably get a ton of shit for Eye Scream. Enjoy, or better<br>yet... don't." ---- Henry Rollins</p><p></p><h2>Secrets of Mental Math</h2><p>One key to expanding your math potential - whether you&#39;re a corporate executive or a high school student - lies in the power to perform mental math calculations.

Brooks introduced Freddy the Pig in Freddy Goes to Florida. Freddy and his friends from Bean Farm migrate south for the winter, with every mile of the way a terrific adventure complete with bumbling robbers and a nasty bunch of alligato</p><p>Birds migrate south for the winter--why shouldn't farm animals? In Walter R. Brooks's <i>Freddy Goes to Florida</i>, that's precisely what the thoughtful beasts of Mr. Bean's upstate New York farm decide to do. Not wanting to leave the imperfect yet kindhearted farm owner in the lurch, they draw straws to select the lucky travelers. A robin draws them a map that shows them how to get to Florida, and they're off! The parade of animals--Jinx the cat, Freddy the pig, Robert the dog, Hank and Mrs. Wiggins the cows, Mr. and Mrs. Webb the spiders, two ducks named Alice, and four mice--causes quite a stir on the cross-country trek. In Washington, D.C., they even meet the president, who "shook them each by the claw or a paw or a hoof." After a series of humorous and suspenseful near misses, including a battle of wits with some Florida alligators, they end up safely back home, where Freddy poetically concludes, "And however they wander, both pigs and men / Are always glad to get home again." Brooks is hilariously tongue-in-cheek; his insightful descriptions of animal characters are always compassionate; and his subtle appeal to a child's instinct for justice is no less than masterful. As Adam Hochschild of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> writes, "The moral center of my childhood universe, the place where good and evil, friendship and treachery, honesty and humbug were defined most clearly, was not church, not school, and not the Boy Scouts. It was the Bean Farm." <p> From 1927 to 1958 Brooks wrote 26 Freddy books--including <i>Freddy the Detective</i>--all focused on the well-rounded pig, who has been described by various fans as ingenious, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. Since Brooks's books fell out of print, librarians across the country have scrounged up copies wherever possible, even resorting to photocopying the books and binding them with hockey-stick tape. Finally, to the delight of thousands, the fabulous Freddy books have been reprinted by Overlook Press. Welcome back, Freddy! (Ages 9 to 12, but great for reading aloud to younger children.) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><b>WALTER R. BROOKS</b> (1886-1958) is the beloved author of 26 books about Freddy the Pig.

Known as Plenty Kill, young Standing Bear belonged to the Western Sioux tribe that inhabited present-day North and South Dakota. In <i>My Indian Boyhood</i> he describes, with clarity and feeling lent by experience, the home life and education of Indian children. Like other boys, he played with toy bows and arrows in the tipi before learning to make and use them and became schooled in the ways of animals and in the properties of plants and herbs. His life would be very different from that of his ancestors, but he was not denied the excitement of killing his first buffalo before leaving to attend the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania.

Strippers need lubricated nails, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mid-sip, I nearly snorted wine up my nose. &#x201c;Josh, you&#x2019;re exactly who I needed to talk to today.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave a little bow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here all night, princess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just wait. It gets worse.&#x201d; I took a long swig. &#x201c;An hour later I hit a huge pothole, blew out two tires, and broke both axles. The tow truck guy who showed up was this little redheaded dude in green overalls who spoke in a thick Irish accent. He took one look at my car and said, &#x2018;Lady, did you forget to have a beer on St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your knight in shining armor was a leprechaun?&#x201d; Josh lowered his chin in disbelief.<br> <br>&#x201c;A leprechaun who chain-smoked the entire way back to Cincinnati.&#x201d; I sniffed my hair. &#x201c;Marlboros, ick! He dropped me off here while my car gets twelve hundred dollars worth of repairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Josh clucked with concern.<br> <br>I rubbed my face. &#x201c;Today is only the latest in a string of bad car luck. In the past two months I&#x2019;ve had four other tire blow-outs, one dead battery, one stopped starter, and two car break-ins. I&#x2019;m on a first-name basis with the AAA dispatcher, and my mechanic gave me his cell phone number with great seriousness, like he was a surgeon on call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably because you&#x2019;re putting his kids through college. That&#x2019;s like the reverse of finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,&#x201d; Josh sympathized. &#x201c;I think you need another drink. This one&#x2019;s on me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, sitting back on my stool and considering my absurd day. &#x201c;You know what the leprechaun tow truck driver reminded me of? The Smurfs. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to watch the Smurfs growing up because my parents thought they were demonic.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was surprised to hear these words leave my mouth; this was not a Fun Life Fact to be casually shared like cocktail peanuts with a bartender.<br> <br>Josh&#x2019;s posture changed from easy-listening bartender to Marine at attention. &#x201c;No effing way! Me too! A teacher at my school said Papa Smurf was a symbol for the anti-Christ, just because he wore a red hat and all the other Smurfs wore white hats.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tilted my head sideways and said slowly, &#x201c;Where did you go to school? It couldn&#x2019;t have been&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Josh beat me to the punch line by breaking out into our small Christian elementary school&#x2019;s fight song. I joined in melodically as we burst out laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut the hell up,&#x201d; exclaimed Josh, his jaw slack. &#x201c;You seem so normal and not Christian-y.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you? The &#x2018;normal&#x2019; part is up for debate.&#x201d; I thought of the portion of my bad day that I hadn&#x2019;t told Josh about, the part where I slumped over my steering wheel, sleeping at a rest stop because chronic illness made me too tired to drive three hours at a stretch. &#x201c;But I definitely haven&#x2019;t been Christian-y in almost a decade.&#x201d;<br> <br>Josh peered at me in belated recognition. &#x201c;Wait. Are you the music teacher&#x2019;s daughter? Rebecca?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded. My mom had taught at Bridgeville Christian all the years my younger sisters and I attended.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Reba now,&#x201d; I said and smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Rebecca without the -ecc.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Reba. Girl. This is crazy.&#x201d; Josh threw his towel over one shoulder and leaned back. &#x201c;Remember the dress code? Bible classes? Scripture memorization? Never-ending altar calls? Oh, and the offense system&#x2014;five offenses equaled a paddling? The principal once paddled me after I got caught making fun of the art teacher. I used to roll under the pews to escape chapel services, and then go smoke pot in the woods.&#x201d; Josh laughed, but the sound was laced with something I knew too well: grief.<br> <br>To understand our evangelical school, simply take everything normal and stir in a measure of God. Learning to read? Start with My First Bible and a recording of &#x201c;Bible Stories for Little Ears.&#x201d; Note the Proverbs-themed wallpaper in the reading group corner. Starting the school day? Pledge allegiance to the American flag, the Christian flag, and the Bible. Doing math? Enjoy lessons from Beyond Math: Arithmetic from a Biblical Worldview. (Even numbers weren&#x2019;t neutral.) Truly, there was not any aspect of life that could not be improved by invoking Christ. Even bathroom breaks could be accomplished to the glory of God, if one flushed the toilet with a joyful spirit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow. I was way too spiritual and serious back then to even think about rebelling, let alone doing drugs. All I ever worried about was whether Jesus was proud of me. God was my everything.&#x201d; I paused and looked into my glass. &#x201c;Would you believe I was in ministry training? I wanted to be a Christian counselor. I even went through years of Christian college and studied at the Focus on the Family Institute.&#x201d;<br> <br>Josh winced at the mention of Focus on the Family, an organization known for encouraging people like him to &#x201c;pray the gay away.&#x201d; I exhaled a weary breath that far exceeded my rough day on the road. We both fell silent for a minute.<br> <br>&#x201c;God was my everything too.&#x201d; Josh took a deep breath. &#x201c;Until I came out. I mean, that&#x2019;s the simple version. Losing faith happens by degrees.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to tell me. I lived it. Not the coming out part&#x2014;unless you count coming out as a nonbeliever. The losing faith by degrees part.&#x201d;<br> <br>Josh and I stared at each other in silent understanding. We hadn&#x2019;t left our religion; our religion had left us.<br> <br>We didn&#x2019;t need to explain to each other what it means to lose your entire identity, or how it feels to lie to yourself&#x2014;Faith doesn&#x2019;t matter, I don&#x2019;t need God, I can get along just fine on my own&#x2014;even when you know the lies will never be true.<br> <br>I lifted my glass in an attempt to brighten the mood. &#x201c;To God,&#x201d; I toasted, &#x201c;the heaviest word in the English language, the word most likely to make me feel like I&#x2019;ve been punched in the stomach!&#x201d;<br> <br>The joke fell flat. Even in jest, God was far too intertwined with a gray-haired father in the sky who doled out eternal punishment to anyone who didn&#x2019;t pray to his shiny son, Jesus Christ.<br> <br>I tried again. &#x201c;To the Godiverse?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The what-iverse?&#x201d; Josh looked puzzled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Godiverse,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s God plus the Universe&#x2014;the word I came up with for Something that&#x2019;s bigger than the Trinity we grew up with, but smaller and more personal than the great beyond.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;To the Godiverse,&#x201d; Josh agreed.<br> <br>We clinked glasses, but our heaviness didn&#x2019;t lift.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man. This Post-Traumatic Church Syndrome stuff sucks,&#x201d; I exclaimed, slamming my glass down in emphasis. Josh cracked a smile at my phrase, so I continued. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know you know the PTCS symptoms: Prayer is out of the question; the Bible is something you use to mop up spilled coffee; you can&#x2019;t darken the door of a place of worship without sweaty palms, vertigo, chest pains, nausea, and vomiting.&#x201d; In an effort to keep things fun, I didn&#x2019;t mention the more destructive side effects of spiritual injury: anger, grief, despair, depression, failure to believe in anything, moral confusion, loss of gravity, and emptiness. &#x201c;You may also experience hives, dry mouth, and a general tendency to avoid church like an escaped convict avoids cops.&#x201d;<br> <br>Josh laughed. &#x201c;Wow. I definitely had one major case of Post-Traumatic Church Syndrome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Had? I must have missed something. It seems like you&#x2019;re still suffering.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked away, thinking. &#x201c;I get upset when I think about all the years I lost because I let other people decide how I could find God. But a few years ago, I started going back to the Nazarene church I grew up in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I&#x2019;ve made my peace with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I choked on my wine. Nazarenes weren&#x2019;t exactly gay-friendly, and Josh wasn&#x2019;t entirely subtle. &#x201c;How does that work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I realized my past didn&#x2019;t have to shackle me.&#x201d; The pain fell away from his features, replaced by peace. &#x201c;I decided to believe what I believe, practice what I practice, and not let anyone or anything get in the way of how I choose to find God. I don&#x2019;t let other people think for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I tried very hard to be happy for Josh, but the best I could manage was a fake smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good for you,&#x201d; I managed to stutter, my thoughts turned upside down. Peace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what a beautiful, unattainable state. Or was it? If Josh could find peace, could I? And what would it mean if I did?<br> <br>I yawned and threw down some cash. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a really long day. I&#x2019;m going to turn in. It&#x2019;s been great talking to you.&#x201d; Promising to keep in touch, we exchanged information and hugs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Reba,&#x201d; Josh called as I walked away, &#x201c;Rejecting someone else&#x2019;s version of reality isn&#x2019;t the same as creating your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a nice idea, I thought later, crawling into my hotel bed, but I&#x2019;m way too tired to think about dealing with my spiritual issues.<br> <br>When I fell asleep, I dreamed of a large, unmarked van parked on the street in front of my house. God, shaggy-haired and lanky, hung out in the van&#x2019;s back cab smoking a cigarette. (Come to think of it, God looked a lot like Ashton Kutcher.) A black-and-white closed circuit television blinked on with a live feed of my life. God watched the screen for a minute before he blew out a slow smoke circle and turned to his divine camera crew: Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and the entire cast of Full House.<br> <br>&#x201c;You guys ready?&#x201d; God asked.<br> <br>The crew nodded, serious as church.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; God said as he put on his headphones and cracked his knuckles. &#x201c;Ready. Set. Action&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;BABY, YOU HAVE TO get up. Everyone is going to be here soon,&#x201d; Trent whispered from the edge of the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cancel,&#x201d; I croaked from beneath the pillow.<br> <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s your party,&#x201d; my husband insisted, nuzzling my neck.<br> <br>I attempted to move my limbs. As usual for a lost day&#x2014;a day I lost to chronic illness&#x2014;my body felt full of lead. I lifted the pillow and looked into my husband&#x2019;s clear blue eyes. &#x201c;Is it really too late to cancel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s 5 p.m. People are already on their way.&#x201d; He flashed an encouraging Superman grin. &#x201c;And I brought you espresso.&#x201d;<br> <br>Untangling my body from the sheets, I gritted my teeth and searched inside myself for birthday cheer. Nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ready in an hour,&#x201d; I promised, dragging my drink to the shower in hopes that the combination of steam and caffeine would loosen the Sickness&#x2019;s painful grip on my body.<br> <br>Wrapped in a towel, I stepped from the shower twenty minutes later and wiped steam from the mirror. My dripping reflection looked exhausted, so I forced a plastic smile and pantomimed a silent laugh until the mirror reflected the image I made sure everyone saw: a happy woman with green eyes and long, dark hair who had it all&#x2014;great husband, successful career, new puppy, high credit score. A carefree woman who didn&#x2019;t suffer from a painful, chronic mystery Sickness that forced her to sleep her days away.<br> <br>A woman who feels a hollow void where her faith used to live, came an unbidden thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa. Where did that come from?&#x201d; I looked around my tiny bathroom, suspecting my shower curtain of spiritual harassment. It looked guilty of nothing more than being a little too red.<br> <br>Shrugging off the intrusion, I returned to my smiling exercise until I felt the Sickness ripple through my joints. I braced against the pain with one hand on the sink and one on the mirror, taking deep breaths. When the pain lessened, I looked at my ashen reflection and saw the woman I really was: the one who had been crying in doctor&#x2019;s offices for years, asking why she couldn&#x2019;t be well.<br> <br>A woman whose spirit is even sicker than her body.<br> <br>I looked around accusingly again, this time at my throw rug, whose only failure was being not quite red enough.<br> <br>The Sickness gripped my joints again. But somehow, beyond the muscle spasms and cramping, I felt the prick of a much deeper pain, one that had been steadily building ever since I&#x2019;d run into Josh several weeks before.<br> <br>I need to believe again.<br> <br>I scanned myself for other signs of craziness: foaming at the mouth, perhaps?<br> <br>I wondered if maybe I was still asleep. Yes, that had to be it. But I felt the steam on my shoulders, the bristling of the towel on my skin, the cool linoleum beneath my feet.<br> <br>I need Josh&#x2019;s peace.<br> <br>No, no, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I tried to resist but it was no use because chronic illness doesn&#x2019;t fight fair: It weakens us and exposes our deepest pains and betrayals just when our body is in pain and betraying us. The dam of denial I&#x2019;d carefully constructed around my Post-Traumatic Church Syndrome&#x2014;the one I&#x2019;d had to create in order to rebuild my life without God&#x2014;had been slowly but steadily dismantled by the Sickness, and I hadn&#x2019;t noticed until it was too late.<br> <br>Angry tears filled my eyes. Wasn&#x2019;t it bad enough that I couldn&#x2019;t fix my body? That I&#x2019;d spent tens of thousands of dollars on doctors, specialists, chiropractors, naturalists, counselors, herbalists, massage therapists, medications, exercises, special diets, and magic vitamins? That I&#x2019;d donated so much blood to testing that I was surprised I had any left? That I&#x2019;d had everything from MRIs to chakras read and reread? All that money and no diagnosis that fit. All those treatments and nothing that helped. My body was getting steadily, heartbreakingly worse. And I was powerless to do anything about it.<br> <br>And now this spiritual crap, too?<br> <br>It was too much. Knees turned to jelly, I made it only three paces to the walk-in closet before collapsing to the worn, tan carpet beneath a rack of old coats.

She has had exhibitions in Bristol, Bath, London, and Stockholm. Kate lives and works in Bristol.Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;There are numerous artist biographies and art primers for kids, but few surveys. Bird's is ambitious: a look at the history of art, from 40,000 BCE to 2014, through 68 fictionalized stories. In his introduction, the author discusses the desire of the artists to connect their "invisible life of thoughts and feelings" with the world, and the stories address just that&#x2014;what the artists might have been thinking about when creating their art, and the objective of the representative work reproduced here. Art historians can only surmise artists' intentions in many works (the "Lion Man" figure carved out of a mammoth tusk), but others are well documented (Ai Weiwei's political statements). The 68 tales are grouped chronologically under subheadings, introduced with information about the era, the impact of technological advancements (the use of perspective, the camera), and so on, providing additional context. World art is included, but the focus is on the West. These selections offer an entry into the lives and works of the men and women represented, but perhaps too discreetly placed, given the audience, is a note in the credits that the (abundant) quotes are "literary inventions" unless otherwise stated. There is also no list of sources. Throughout, delightful watercolors add details, while informative illustrated spreads impart facts on hubs of creativity over the years: Angkor Wat in the 1100s, Florence in the 1400s, Amsterdam in the 1600s, New York in the 1950s.

Combining his artistic abilities, wild imagination, and his passion for small houses, he self-published <i>Humble Homes, Simple Shacks, Cozy Cottages, Ramshackle Retreats, Funky Forts, and Whatever the Heck Else we could Squeeze in Here</i> in 2009. This book is a collection of Diedricksen&#x2019;s creative/imaginative sketches for building small houses, shacks, cottages, and forts. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sketches are accompanied with hand-written commentary, both instructive and comical. Derek&#x2019;s main purpose is to get your creative juices flowing and encourage you to get off the couch and use your hands. Believing that specific building plans squash creativity, he avoids too many detailed instructions, giving you the chance to put your own creative spin on your very own small abode (even if it is just in your imagination). &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Derek (&#x201c;Deek&#x201d;) Diedricksen</b> was born and raised in Madison, Connecticut, and is a graduate of Northeastern University.

Deek aims to inspire with his ideas, ideas that may well earn his book a place in tiny house history. What he ends up doing is reconstructing the mind into accepting what constitutes shelter. Deek&#x2019;s book is important not so much because it is another entertaining zine produced by an overly creative young person, but because he is both fed by a movement and contributing a large chunk to it with his mind bending, Houdini like acts of radically small, home-built shelters. --Amanda Kovattana- of Dï¿½jï¿½ Vu Construction (CA)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Humble Homes...&#x201d; </i>explores the possibilities of the small home ~ and is the single craziest, most unique book I have ever seen.

It embodies the essence of years of thought, study, and experiment on the part of its author whose original research, discoveries, and writings along these lines have given him his worldwide reputation as an authority. It is his Masterpiece. A portion of its material was used in two of the author&#39;s previous works, viz., &#34;Mental Magic,&#34; and &#34;Mental Fascination,&#34; both of which works were published by ourselves. Both of the said works are now practically out of print, and will be withdrawn from sale by us, as they will be superseded by this newer and more complete work. This foundation material has been edited; added to; changed; improved; and corrected by the author, in accordance with his increased experience and knowledge of the subject. Obsolete matter has been replaced by entirely new material, and the work is now strictly &#34;up-to-date&#34;. It is encyclopaedic in extent and character, every phase of the subject being considered by the author and expressed in words charged with his dynamic vitality. It contains matter that well might have been expanded into several volumes.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Considered by some to be his masterpiece, this 1912 work is the culmination of decades worth of study by William Walker Atkinson, one of the most influential thinkers of the early-20th-century "New Age" philosophy of New Thought, which encouraged its adherents to learn the secrets of mind over matter. They did so via Atkinson's instruction, and here, in one concise volume, are his lessons on: <p> * mental magic * desire and will * personal magnetism * mind-power in action * four kinds of suggestion * and more.</p></p><h2>Warrior Pups: True Stories of America&#39;s K9 Heroes</h2><p>Lavishly illustrated with full-color photos throughout, Warrior Pups takes you behind-the-scenes into the lives of the fiercely dedicated military men and women and their civilian supporters who make the US Military Working Dog program the success that it is. It has been estimated that during its six-year career in the field, each Military Working Dog saves the lives of 150 American and coalition soldiers by detecting hidden IEDs and disrupting ambushes.<br><br>Emmy-Award-winning broadcast journalist Jeff Kamen and his wife Leslie Stone-Kamen were granted unprecedented access to the closed K9 world of trainers and handlers inside Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, the headquarters of the US Military Working Dog Program, and into the lives of the civilian and military volunteers who foster the baby pups. At any given moment, there are an estimated 700 young dogs in various stages of training at the base. Some are purchased overseas and arrive as canine adolescents. Other warrior pups are born at Lackland. The program is led by canine behaviorist Dr. Stewart H., who everyone at Lackland simply calls "Doc." His apporach to dog training is founded on a deep love and respect for the dogs. The Dog Training School's superb instructors hone the dogs&#x2019; innate drives to hunt, fight, and protect. <br><br>The dog/handler team goes first into battle ahead of the troops, sniffing out hidden IEDs, booby traps, and ambushes. American K-9 units are so effective that the enemy often targets them first. The only way handlers can summon the necessary courage is to have rock solid faith in the abilities of their highly trained dogs. Warrior Pups captures that courage, faith, and love on every page.</p><p>Award-winning journalist Jeff Kamen is the co-author with Robert Kupperman of Final Warning: Averting Disaster in the New Age of Terrorism.

Leslie Stone-Kamen, a photojournalist and retired Doctor of Oriental Medicine, is Jeff's partner in life and in Warrior Pups. Her favorite photo in the book captures the moment when the chief dog trainer at Lackland AFB reassured a puppy by crooning to him and rocking him in his arms like a baby. They live in Virginia."Warrior Pups is an important and a fun read filled with great dogs and interesting people. It takes you places you otherwise cannot go--behind the scenes at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where America's Military Working Dogs are bred, nurtured and trained.

Reissue.</p><p>Matt Scudder, the recovering alcoholic private eye from The Devil Knows You&#39;re Dead and A Ticket to the Boneyard, embarks on another descent into the nightmarish quarters of New York, this time to investigate the sex-for-sale industry. Hired by the brother of an heiress to investigate her rape and murder, Scudder tails her husband to a boxing match and notices another man whom he saw on video a few months earlier on a different case involving a snuff film. As Scudder calls on old friends for assistance and tours New York&#39;s dark physical and social landscapes, Block masterfully builds the pressure that leads Scudder to the violent resolution in this winner of the 1992 Edgar Award for best mystery novel.There is no accolade or major mystery award that has not already been bestowed upon LAWRENCE BLOCK. His acclaimed crime novels are as intelligent, provocative, and emotionally complex as they are nerve-tighteningly intense. And perhaps the most respected of his myriad works are the Matthew Scudder books -- masterworks of suspenseful invention featuring a remarkable protagonist rich in conscience and character, with all the flaws that his humanity entails. This is the detective novel as high art.<p>In Matt Scudder's mind, money, power, and position elevate nobody above morality and the law. Now the ex-cop and unlicensed p.i. has been hired to prove that socialite Richard Thurman orchestrated the brutal murder of his beautiful, pregnant wife. During Scudder's hard drinking years, he left a piece of his soul on every seedy corner of the Big Apple. But this case is more depraved and more potentially devastating than anything he experienced while floundering in the urban depths. Because this investigation is leading Scudder on a frightening grand tour of New York's sex-for-sale underworld -- where an innocent young life is simply a commodity to be bought and perverted...and then destroyed.</p></p><h2>Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda</h2><p>minor corner wear</p><p>Romeo Dallaire joined the Canadian Army in 1964. A three star General, he served as Deputy Commander of the Canadian Army and later in the Ministry of Defence. In 1993 he was sent to Rwanda on a UN peace-helping mission; he was soon struggling to prevent one of modern history&#39;s most shocking events and the UN&#39;s famous failed mission: the genocide in Rwanda. General Dallaire was medically released from the armed forces in April 2000 due to posttraumatic stress disorder and is now special adviser to the Canadian government on war-affected children and the prohibition of small arms distribution. In January 2002, he received the inaugural Aegis Award for Genocide Prevention in London. The Rwandan genocide is one of the most shocking examples of political exploitation and ethnic cleansing in living memory. It has been immortalised in the films Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs, and here in the words of a seasoned soldier.*Starred Review* On June 27, 1993, Dallaire--a career man in the Canadian military--was informed that he might be asked to lead a UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda, to which he replied excitedly, "Rwanda, that's somewhere in Africa, isn't it?" Fourteen months later, he would return from his service there a nearly broken man, having failed to prevent the unfathomable massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and Hutus, which took place over a mere 100 days. From meticulous diary entries he wrote during his service there, Dallaire pieces together the inside story of what went wrong. He puts unsparing blame on the circular failure of the UN: lack of support from member countries, especially the U.S and the Security Council, which led to lack of respect for the UN, which then led to lack of support from member countries. He blames the warring sides, especially extremist Hutus, for planning the genocide during peace talks, knowing the UN would not have the courage to enforce the peace: "They knew us better than we knew ourselves." And he blames himself for his political naivete and his inability to convince the UN of the gravity of the situation, which has now spread to neighboring Congo. For those who would understand the inexorable but entirely preventable unfolding of the Rwandan holocaust, this account, told from the eye of the storm, is indispensable. <i>Alan Moores</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

He gives them what they need to finally 'get it.''' <br> --from the foreword by Jerry Leachman<br><br> Men just ''get'' this book! It seems to resonate with them. Men who don't normally read many books read this one and then want to get it into the hands of others. Why? Because Richard Simmons ''gets it'' --he identifies the ultimate issue all men face regardless of their age, occupation, or marital status.<br><br> ''Men so often define themselves by what they do, who they know, or what they own. And when they do so, they unwittingly set themselves up for great confusion and failure in their personal lives.'' --Richard Simmons<br><br> Gathering support from the writings of noted authors and social commentators, Christian and secular, Simmons emphatically reminds us that every man at some point in life suffers misfortune. No one is exempt. However, the challenges of life offer men the potential for great good. In the midst of these struggles, Simmons writes, we have the opportunity to see our lives transformed. <br><br> <i>The True Measure of a Man</i> is uplifting, challenging, and most of all it points the way to personal and spiritual growth--based on the one, true measure we were meant to use!<br><br> <i>The True Measure of a Man</i> creates a new benchmark for success.

This book clears up the confusion surrounding the Lutheran faith and shows what distinguishes historic, orthodox Lutheranism from liberal Lutheranism. It also presents a valuable comparison and contrast of strengths and weaknesses for each American Lutheran church body.<br></p><p></p><h2>Walking Through Your Bible with H.M.S.

By the author of Flim-Flam.</p><p>Drawing on histories, documents and his own contacts, "The Amazing Randy," a magician also known for his work unmasking fraudulent psychics, here provides a broad but ultimately unsatisfying history of magic and its performers. Beginning with tales of Egypt and India, Randi discusses such ancient tricks as the Cups &amp; Balls routine and the role of machines like the automaton. He traces the careers of performers "Chung Ling Soo" (an early 20th-century conjurer who was not in fact Chinese but a disguised American), the famous Blackstone and Houdini. While the many illustrations (75 in color, 115 in black-and-white) are entertaining--especially those of old posters advertising performances--the book becomes tedious as it degenerates into a collection of brief profiles of relatively obscure performers. Worse, Randi's decision not to reveal how any of the tricks were done is frustrating, given his otherwise detailed descriptions of the life and work of conjurers. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The price of salt</h2><p><p><strong>Now recognized as a masterwork, the scandalous novel that anticipated Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i>.</strong></p>"I have long had a theory that Nabokov knew <i>The Price of Salt</i> and modeled the climactic cross-country car chase in <i>Lolita</i> on Therese and Carol's frenzied bid for freedom," writes Terry Castle in <i>The New Republic</i> about this novel, arguably Patricia Highsmith's finest, first published in 1952 under the pseudonym Clare Morgan. Soon to be a new film, <i>The Price of Salt</i> tells the riveting story of Therese Belivet, a stage designer trapped in a department-store day job, whose salvation arrives one day in the form of Carol Aird, an alluring suburban housewife in the throes of a divorce. They fall in love and set out across the United States, pursued by a private investigator who eventually blackmails Carol into a choice between her daughter and her lover. With this reissue, <i>The Price of Salt</i> may finally be recognized as a major twentieth-century American novel.</p><p><p>A chance encounter between two lonely women leads to a passionate romance in this lesbian cult classic. Therese, a struggling young sales clerk, and Carol, a homemaker in the midst of a bitter divorce, abandon their oppressive daily routines for the freedom of the open road, where their love can blossom. But their newly discovered bliss is shattered when Carol is forced to choose between her child and her lover.<br>Author Patricia Highsmith is best known for her psychological thrillers <i>Strangers on a Train</i> and <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i> Originally published in 1952 under a pseudonym, <i>The Price of Salt</i> was heralded as "the novel of a love society forbids." Highsmith's sensitive treatment of fully realized characters who defy stereotypes about homosexuality marks a departure from previous lesbian pulp fiction.

Cabot Professor, Emeritus, of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Harvard University.It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to think of Stanley Cavell's <i>The World Viewed</i> as simply a film book...Cavell's book is about films...at a thoroughly engaged level of reflection...It does not move one to rush to the nearest movie theater for a new immersion in films; rather, it prompts one to reexamine one's own past experiences of films...With Cavell the sense of the claims which movies make upon us is intense. He does not linger over any particular one, in a spirit of impatience roughly analogous to the one which prompted T. S. Eliot to say the `The poetry does not matter.' The poetry does not matter, poetry matters. The film does not matter, film matters. (<i>College English</i>)<br><br>Perhaps more than in any other country, film studies in the United States have been hampered by a tradition of casual reporting and a smuggish academic refusal to allow a mass entertainment art any serious intellectual status. Stanley Cavell's <i>The World Viewed</i> is an important a valuable counter to this tradition and its journalistic judgments...As a philosopher of art, Cavell is clearly not only a rigorous thinker but an imaginative one who can convincingly integrate phenomenological concepts into film studies or translate figures from Baudelaire's <i>Painter of Modern Life</i> into illuminating categories of film analysis.

Hejduk's stylized paintings are in many ways remarkable, but not enough so to make this latest volume a standout. Based on Jacobs's classic 1894 collection, the text of these 14 fables retains much of his formal language and impersonal approach. This formality is in contrast to the relaxed, almost primeval quality of the artwork. Executed in tempera, the paintings are reminiscent of petroglyphs and Central American molas; each illustrates a complete fable and subtly conveys action through the positioning of the flat figures. But as innovative as these paintings are, the odd choice of color and lack of detail are more likely to appeal to adults. --Denise Anton Wright, Library Book Selection Service, Inc., Bloomington, IL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sober Revolution: Women Calling Time on Wine O&#39;Clock (- Addiction Recovery series)</h2><p>Do you count down the minutes to wine o&#x2019;clock on a daily basis?

A disembodied doll head, caught with the carcass of a whale on a remote island, where crofters once combed for driftwood.

And this takes courage and delicacy" (<i>The Guardian</i>).</p></p><p><p>The award-winning poet and essayist <b>Kathleen Jamie</b> was born in the west of Scotland in 1962. A part-time lecturer in creative writing at St. Andrews University, she lives with her family in Fife, Scotland.</p>Prose essays of a sharpness of looking, and directness of thought, that will make them last a long time; some of the best writing out of rural Scotland for many decades. Jamie observes the extraordinary, alien natural world around her with a frank uncluttered candour, while nevertheless standing rooted in the middle of modern family life. -- Andrew Marr Kathleen Jamie is a supreme listener. Her attention - to the beckoning calls of the peregrines that nest near her house, to the brimful darkness in the neolithic chambers at Maes Howe, to the mute appeals of embryo skeletons in a medical museum - has a directness that borders on the heroic. And in the quietness of her listening, you hear her own voice: clear, subtle, respectful, and so unquenchably curious that it makes the world anew. This is as close as writing gets to a conversation with the natural world. -- Richard Mabey From the moment you meet Kathleen Jamie&#39;s words, you meet a passion for the environment, not as an abstract quality but as what surrounds her...the small birds in the garden, the landscapes of her native Scotland, even ordinary familiar domestic cares are illuminated with curiosity, affection, knowledge and a deep concern. -- Rosalind Coward, writer and journalist</p><h2>The Sacred Cauldron: Psychotherapy as a Spiritual Practice</h2><p>At a time when psychotherapy seems to be a purely secular pursuit with no connection to the sacred, <i>The Sacred Cauldron</i> makes the startling claim that, for both participants, psychotherapeutic work is actually a spiritual discipline in its own right. The psyche manifests the sacred and provides the transpersonal field within which the work of therapy is carried out. This book demonstrates some of the ways in which a spiritual sensibility can inform the technical aspects of psychotherapy.</p><p><b>Dr. Lionel Corbett</b> trained in medicine and psychiatry in England and as a Jungian analyst at the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago. He is currently on the core faculty of Pacifica Graduate Institute in Santa Barbara, California, and the author of <i>The Religious Function of the Psyche</i> and <i>Psyche and the Sacred,</i> as well as various professional articles. His main interest is in the religious function of the psyche and the ways in which this function expresses itself through the structures of personality.<i>&#x201c;The Sacred Cauldron</i> is truly a book to be read by both therapists and non-therapists, for it offers a thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive passage through the spiritual quarrels and complexities of our time and addresses our common summons, which is to treat the life of the spirit with the respect, the gravity, and the centrality it deserves. This book is instructive to all, for Corbett not only marshals a wealth of scholarship and clinical experience, but also expresses challenging insights through a calm, reasonable, and commonsense appeal. After this book, the reader will be more thoughtful, more considered, more sophisticated, more appreciative of the importance of therapy as a vehicle for healing and for engaging the numinous.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>James Hollis</b>, Ph.D., Jungian analyst and author of <i>What Matters Most: Living a More Considered Life</i></p><h2>Golden Boy</h2><p>Paul Hornung was football's "Golden Boy" -- handsome, talented, and fabulously successful.

Hornung led the NFL in scoring from 1959 to 1961, setting a single-season scoring record in 1960 that still stands. He was Player of the Year in 1960 and 1961. <br> Hornung always loved the good life. He had girlfriends all across the country, and he was a regular at Toots Shor's and at clubs in Chicago and Los Angeles. A frustrated Lombardi once asked him whether he wanted to be a player or a playboy, and his teammates joked about his Hollywood ambitions. On game days Hornung was always ready to play, but the night after a game -- and sometimes even the night before -- was a different story. <br> For Hornung, the good life came at a price: his gambling cost him a year's suspension from the NFL in 1963. He accepted his punishment, refusing to implicate anyone else, but in this autobiography he reveals just how widespread gambling was in the NFL. <br> However, on the playing field Hornung and his Packer teammates made football history. Bart Starr, Max McGee, Jim Taylor, Ray Nitschke, Jerry Kramer, Jim Ringo, Ron Kramer, Forrest Gregg, Fuzzy Thurston, Willie Davis, Herb Adderley, Willie Wood -- they're all here, and Hornung has great stories to tell about them and about some of their biggest games together. <br> <i>Golden Boy</i> is a must-read for football fans, a colorful, candid slice of pigskin history from one of the game's immortal legends.</p><p><b>Paul Hornung</b> is a member of the high school, college, and pro football halls of fame. After his playing days ended, he began new careers as a broadcaster, an actor, and a pitchman in television commercials. He currently broadcasts Monday Night Football on the Westwood One radio network. He lives in Louisville, Kentucky.Hornung personified his nickname, "Golden Boy," on many levels&#x2014;as a football star; a handsome, hard-partying ladies' man; and a friend to the rich and beautiful&#x2014;and his autobiography covers each aspect of his life in a colorful and up-front manner. The book, "as told to William F. Reed," is conversational in tone; readers will feel as if they're one of Hornung's Packer teammates or drinking buddies reminiscing about the good old days. Hornung was good at pretty much everything he did, and he lets readers know it. But the bragging and name-dropping (from JFK and Frank Sinatra to mobsters and countless showgirls) is balanced by Hornung's genuine love and respect for his mother, his Packers coach Vince Lombardi and his teammates and friends. Hornung honestly reflects on the blemishes on his golden halo, like his 1963 suspension for gambling. Since he's always acknowledged his guilt, this isn't tremendous news, but, admirably, Hornung does praise Pete Rozelle, the NFL commissioner who suspended him. Interestingly, he also says he tried to persuade Pete Rose, to no avail, to follow his lead and admit his gambling problem. Finally, Hornung convincingly apologizes for his "stupid remarks" in March 2004 (he commented that his alma mater, Notre Dame, must lower its academic standards to "get the black athlete"). While not a shining literary achievement, this is an entertaining autobiography. Photos. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Unbelievably, Father wonders why! Yet he doesn't hesitate to sell the pup to the first man who stops by to inquire. The new owner, a clown, intends to use Walter for a bank heist by fastening him to a "fart-catcher" in order to inflate balloons with his obnoxious-smelling gas. As the clown pops the balloons in the bank, customers and bank tellers are overcome with the stench. When the perp arrives home with the sack of money, he lights a cigar and is launched across the room because of a gas leak. Walter runs out the door toward his former home, and the police follow the trail of $100 bills fluttering behind him. As they try to arrest Walter, he leads them back to the real culprit. Pages are busy with digital illustrations that give an olive green pallor to the human skin tone and a garish look to the clown.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, German artists, writers, scholars, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were leading their freshly unified country to new and unimagined heights. By 1933, Germans had won more Nobel Prizes than any other nationals, and more than the British and Americans combined. Yet this remarkable genius was cut down in its prime by Adolf Hitler and his disastrous Third Reich&#x2014;a brutal legacy that has overshadowed the nation's achievements ever since.</p><p>How did the Germans transform their country so as to achieve such pre-eminence? In this absorbing cultural and intellectual history, Peter Watson goes back through time to explore the origins of the Germangenius, and he explains how and why it flourished, how it shaped our lives, and, most important, how it continues to influence our world. As he convincingly demonstrates, it was German thinking&#x2014;from Beethoven and Kant to Diesel and Nietzsche, from Goethe and Wagner to Mendel and Planck, from Hegel and Marx to Freud and Schoenberg&#x2014;that was paramount in the creation of the modern West. Moreover, despite World War II, figures such as Joseph Beuys, Jï¿½rgen Habermas, and Joseph Ratzinger ensure that the German genius still resonates intellectually today.</p>Peter Watson was born in 1943 and was educated at universities in Durham, London and Rome. He has been on the staff of the Sunday Times and The Times, and has written for many other newspapers. He is the author of over a dozen books including Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud. He lives in London.</p><h2>Walt Disney&#39;s Cinderella (Reissue) (Walt Disney&#39;s Classic Fairytale)</h2><p>"This is a story about darkness and light, about sorrow and joy, about something lost and something found.

Mary Blair painted the original pictures for Walt Disney's incomparable animated film, and here her elegant art is gathered together as a picture book. Cynthia Rylant's stories about hardscrabble lives have won not only awards and honors, but hearts. Who better to take a young girl from the darkness of her garret room to the light and brilliance of a ballroom? Together these two great artists have created something quite astonishing: a Cinderella that is breathtaking, heartrending, and joyous, both for those who are coming to the tale for the very first time, and for those who think they know it well.</p><p>Cynthia Rylant has written more than 100 children's books, from board books and picture books, to chapter books and novels. Rylant won the Newbery Medal for her novel <i>Missing May, </i>and a Newbery Honor for <em>A Fine White Dust.</em> She's also the author of two Caldecott Honor books and more than twenty Henry and Mudge chapter books.

Although Stephens and Catherwood traveled without maps into the wilds of a region gripped by civil war, their detailed descriptions and drawings of the great "lost" civilization gave birth to Maya archaeology and led many others to follow in their footsteps.<br>This new edition brings the best of both Stephens's narrative and Catherwood's drawings into a single volume with an added selection of photographs - many never before published - that expand a reader's view of the Maya ruins, the cities and scenes along the journey, and the native peoples whose cultures endure today. The illustrations include nineteenth-century scenes by the renowned photographer Eadweard Muybridge, portraits of Guatemalan Indians from the Smithsonian's Emilio Herbruger collection, and Osbert Salvin's early photos of Copan. More recent photographs of Guatemala by Jacques and Parney VanKirk and of the Lacandon in Mexico by Gertrude Duby Blom capture the timeless nature of the lands of the Maya that persists into the twentieth century.<br>Now enhanced with historical and modern photographs, this new, one-volume edition of Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan is organized for the traveler by place and omits descriptions of Stephens's voyages to and from the region and his short trips to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as some long historical digressions and anecdotes. It will remain a classic of travel literature and Maya archaeology.</p><p>John Lloyd Stephens (1805-1852) was an American politician who is renowned for his pioneering research into the ancient Maya civilisation. First published in 1841, this book describes the ancient Mayan sites he visited in 1839 and 1840. Volume 2 contains his descriptions of Palenque, Uxmal and other Mayan sites.Stephens's book, first published in two volumes in 1841, has been abridged by Karl Ackerman, a freelance writer. Stephens made his journey in 1839-40, accompanied by an artist, Frederick Catherwood, who made detailed drawings of the Mayan ruins. The book was extremely popular upon publication; it remains an exciting 19th-century travel work and one of the early descriptions--and an incisive one--of the Mayan ruins. Ackerman's abridgment makes a handsome volume, but the continuity is not smooth, and the work could do with more explanatory footnotes. There are no contemporary photographs, of course, but later ones by Edward Muybridge and others are used, including some of Tikal, which Stephens did not visit. The book is useful but will not replace the original work or subsequent reprints with Catherwood's drawings.<br><i>- George M.

After teaching French at universities in Romania and Egypt, he joined the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, where he devoted himself to research in sociology and lexicology. He was a professor at the College de France until his death in 1980.<br>"Barthes's career was an exemplary search for understanding how man creates meaning, a lifelong exploration of man's definition as <i>Homo significans, </i>the maker of meaning in signs. In anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, and the discourse upon literature, this has been a characteristic preoccupation of our age, and no one addressed himself to it so persistently, so multifariously, so ingeniously, as Barthes." --Peter Brooks,<i> The New Republic</i><br></p><h2>The JFK Assassination: The Facts and the Theories</h2><p>The JFK Assassination: The Facts and the Theories</p><p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s Garden of Grass: The Official Handbook for Marijuana Users</h2><p>A Child&#39;s Garden of Grass [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>A Day in the Life of America</h2><p>Good book in good condition</p><p>The latest, and by far the most ambitious, in the A Day in the Life seriesthat the enterprising team of Smolan and Cohen have put together in recent years is at once extremely substantial and unexpectedly light. In weight and size it is a hefty blockbuster; but the more than 250 pictures, mostly in color, generally avoid the kind of heavy-breathing grandiosity and flowery patriotism the titleand the timesmight indicate. The formula, as spelled out in Smolan's letter to the hundreds of participating photographers from all around the world, is simple: on one dayin this case last May 2they fan out all over the country and shoot what takes their fancy. The more than a quarter-million shots that result are then edited down to the final book. There is little structure, other than that the book begins at dawn and ends late at night. The captions vary in length and cogency, and there is a longish self-congratulatory section at the end of the book about the many skills needed to bring it off. But it is the pictures themselves that count, and they are for the most part impressive. There is a welcome emphasis on people at work rather than on scenery, and a minimum of gimmickry and obviously set-up shots; it is good, too, to see handsome black-and-white images in a book of this scope.

The novel begins with a bang as Reacher rescues Beck's son from a staged kidnapping in order to get close to his father--and trace the connection between Beck and Quinn, a former army intelligence officer who tried to sell blueprints of a secret weapon to Iraq but was murdered before he could pull it off. Or so Reacher thinks, until he spots Quinn in the crowd at a concert in Boston. As usual, Child ratchets up the tension and keeps the reader in suspense until the last page, although his enigmatic hero hardly ever seems to break a sweat. In the tough guy tradition, Reacher and his creator are overdue for a breakout, and this muscular, well-written mystery might be the one. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Jack Reacher.<br><br></b>The ultimate loner.<br><br>An elite ex-military cop who left the service years ago, he?s moved from place to place?without family?without possessions?without commitments.<br><br>And without fear.

His 2007 novel,&nbsp;<i>Last Night at the Lobster</i>,&nbsp;was a national bestseller and a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize. He was born and raised in Pittsburgh, where he lives with his family.<p>In Memoriam</p><p>His mother named him Henry, after her older brother, a chaplain killed in the Great War, as if he might take his place. In family lore the dead Henry had been a softhearted boy, a rescuer of stranded earthworms and fallen sparrows, presaging his vocation as a saver of souls. Salutatorian of his seminary class, he volunteered for duty overseas, sending home poems and charcoal sketches of life in the trenches. At church the stained-glass window that showed a barefoot Christ carrying a wayward lamb draped about his neck like a stole was dedicated in loving memory of the Rt. Rev. Henry Leland Chase, 1893-1917, the mock-Gothic inscription so elaborate it verged on illegibility, and each Sunday as they made their way to their pew up front, his mother would bow her head as they passed, as if to point out, once more, his uncle's saintliness. When he was little, Henry believed he was buried there, that beneath the cold stone floor of Calvary Episcopal, as below the medieval cathedrals of Europe, the noble dead moldered in cobwebbed catacombs, and that one day he would be there too.<br>When Henry was eight, his mother enrolled him as an altar boy, a vocation for which he betrayed no calling, picking at his nails inside his billowy sleeves through the weighted silences and turgid hymns, afraid he'd miss his cue. He had nightmares of arriving late for the processional in his baseball uniform, his cleats clicking as the holy conclave paraded down the aisle. The cross was heavy, and he needed to stretch on tiptoe with the brass taper to light the massive Alpha-Omega candle. Funerals were the worst, held Saturday afternoons when all of his friends would be at their secret clubhouse deep in the park. The grieving family huddled beside the casket, praying with Father McNulty for the repose of their loved one's soul, but once the service was done and the candles snuffed, the funeral director took charge, bossing around the pallbearers like hired porters as they lugged the box down the front steps and slid it into the hearse. Invariably Henry pictured his uncle, his nose inches from the closed lid, on a train crossing bomb-pocked French farmland, or in the dark hold of a ship, cold water gliding by outside the thin steel skin of the hull. He had so many friends and well-wishers, the story went, that the visitation-in their grandparents' front parlor, where his sister Arlene taught Henry to play "Heart and Soul" on their Baldwin-lasted three days and nights.<br>Arlene was named after Arlene Connelly, his mother's favorite singer, which Henry thought unfair.<br>To avoid confusion, among company his mother called him Henry Maxwell and his uncle Henry Chase, a nicety her side of the family dispensed with, christening him Little Henry.<br>Henry-though not one to make a fuss-would have preferred a nickname of his own choosing, something rough and masculine like Hank or Huck. He thought Little Henry was bad luck, and in private moments, rooting through his father's workbench in the cellar for a spool of kite string, or of on a rainy day, hiding from Arlene in the lumber room beneath the eaves, or after midnight, climbing the boxed back stairwell with a filched sticky bun, he felt watched over by a ghost neither kindly nor malevolent, merely a silent presence noting his every move like a judge. His mother never said precisely how his uncle had died, leaving Henry, with a child's dire imagination, to picture, in a flash, a German shell catapulting a rag doll of a doughboy through the air, scattering his limbs over a cratered no-man's-land, one arm caught in a coil of barbed wire, the hand still clutching a small gold cross.<br>On his mother's dresser, in a silver frame that captured fingerprints, surrounded by other, less interesting relatives from before Henry was born, stood a bleached Kodak of her brother on the dock at Chautauqua, proudly holding up a glistening muskie. Each time Henry snuck into his parents' bedroom to puzzle over this snapshot as if it were a clue to his future, he remarked that the fish, like his uncle, was long dead, while the dock and cottage were still there at the water's edge, awaiting them every summer like a stage set, but exactly how these facts were related he couldn't say, only that he felt vaguely guilty looking at the young and happy not-yet-reverend Henry Chase, as if he'd stolen something from him.</p><p>Pedigree</p><p>The Pittsburgh Maxwells-no relation to the automakers or coffee company-came from the moors of North Yorkshire, with the main concentration around Skelton. Originally sheepherders and tenant farmers, after the signing of the Magna Carta their descendants filtered into the village proper and became at first guildsmen and then merchants, one, John Lee Maxwell, ultimately serving as a tax collector and deacon in the Church of England. Generations later, an intrepid or maybe disgraced scion of that line, John White Maxwell, sailed on the Godspeed for the Virginia Colony at Jamestown, there taking as his wife the fourteen-year-old Susanna Goode. This according to a genealogy compiled by a retired pharmacist from Olathe, Kansas, named Arthur Maxwell, a pair of which Emily, whose AOL address had been included in a mass email the week of Thanksgiving, purchased sight unseen as Christmas presents for their two grown children, Margaret and Kenny. Rather than gilt-edged, leather-bound keepsake editions, what arrived by regular mail in a crushed Amazon box several days after the children had packed up the grandchildren and as many leftovers as Emily could foist on them and fled were two overstuffed three-ring binders of cockeyed photocopies riddled with errors both typographical and factual, including the incorrect year of his uncle's death.<br>Henry made the mistake of laughing.<br>"I'm glad you find it amusing," Emily said. "I paid good money for these."<br>"How much were they?"<br>"It doesn't matter. I'm getting it back."<br>He doubted that was possible but nodded thoughtfully. "It's fascinating stuff if it's true. It says here we were horse thieves."<br>"I'm not happy. It was supposed to be a big gift. It's too late now anyway. At this point I'm thinking I should just send them back."<br>They'd been married nearly fifty years, and still he had to smother the masculine urge to counsel her on how the world worked. At the same time, agreeing with her too readily would be seen as appeasement, a worse offense, and so, as he often did on matters of little import, he chose the safest response, silence.<br>"Nothing?" she asked. "You have no opinion whatsoever."<br>He'd forgotten: He wasn't allowed to be neutral.<br>"I think it's interesting. Let's keep one for ourselves at least."<br>"Honestly," she said, backhanding the page she was reading, "I could do this. I'm going to send him an email."<br>The holidays were hard on her. It didn't have to be the genealogy, it could be Rufus throwing up on the carpet, or some passing comment of Arlene's about the mashed potatoes. Lately the smallest things set her off, and though in her looser moments she freely admitted that she'd always been a terror, an only child used to getting her way, as her husband he feared her impatience hinted at some deeper frustration with life and, by extension, their marriage. In this case his hope was that she would cool off and eventually relent, that the bother of repacking the binders and running them over to the post office would outweigh her anger. Her moods were fleeting, and the man had obviously done a lot of work. As if tabling the issue, she set the box out of the way, upstairs, on the cedar chest in Kenny's old room, where it stayed well into the new year (1998, incredibly), until one day at lunch she asked if they had any packing tape.<br>"Did you get your refund?"<br>"Only after I bugged him a million times. He said we could keep them, but I'm not going to. He's got to understand he can't do this to people."<br>"Right." So, his copy too. A traitor, he'd enjoyed finding out more about his Kentucky cousins, and General Roland Pawling Maxwell, the hero of Yorktown.<br>"I didn't want to tell you, they were sixty dollars apiece. For sixty dollars, they should be nice, and they're not."<br>"I agree," he said, honestly shocked at the price. For all their differences, they were both thrifty.<br>"It's a shame, because there were other ones I could have ordered."<br>"It was a nice idea."<br>"If you want to try, have at it. I'm not doing that again."<br>"At least you got your money back."<br>Again, he was missing the point. She'd wanted to do something special for the children and it had turned into a debacle.<br>He would never understand why she took these defeats to heart. There was nothing you could do about them.<br>"I'm sorry," he said.<br>"Why? It's not your fault. Just let me be angry. I'm allowed to be angry."<br>He had to run out later and grab some new wiper blades for the Olds. The post office was right on his way.<br>"That would be helpful," she said. "If you don't mind."<br>He didn't mind, though, alone in the Olds, cruising down Highland with the defroster going, he glanced over at the box on the seat beside him and frowned as if she'd tricked him.</p><p>Near Miss</p><p>He'd lived in Highland Park his entire life, so he could be excused if he thought of the stop sign at Bryant-installed over a decade ago-as new, but in truth, that afternoon he never registered it. He was still picking at the knot of Emily's unhappiness when he realized a school bus was pulling out in front of him, tall as a boxcar, and that he'd ram it broadside if he didn't stop. Too late, the driver saw him and honked, and at the last second Henry jammed on the brakes. The tires screeched and the nose of the Olds dove. The box flew off the seat, smacked the dash and bounced around the floor.<br>He was short by a couple of feet. He was lucky the road was dry.<br>"Damn it," he said, because he was at fault. The sign was behind him. He hadn't even seen it.<br>The driver threw up his hands and glared.<br>"Sorry," Henry said, and held up his own as if he meant no harm. Above him, children who might have been first graders peered down from the windows, pointing and making faces, bouncing on their seats like trampolines. He was the excitement. It was on the local news every night, the old fart who hit the gas instead of the brake and ended up inside the dry cleaners.<br>Henry expected the driver to jump out and yell at him, but the bus eased forward, clearing the intersection, and kept going. The car behind it waited for Henry to take his turn.<br>He nodded. "Thank you."<br>He wanted to protest that he was a careful driver, not like Emily, who couldn't see at night and four-wheeled over curbs, and the rest of the way to the post office and then coming home he concentrated, lips pinched, eyes darting to cars peeking from side streets. It was one slip, but all it took was one, and he worried that it might have happened before, he just hadn't noticed. Near the tail end of his life, his father couldn't see well. When they visited him, all four corners of his bumpers were smudged with different-colored paint. He refused to give up his license, even after being stopped repeatedly by the police for driving too slowly. After he died, Henry rolled up the garage door of his condo and discovered the whole front of his Cutlass was pushed in, as if he'd hit a wall.<br>His father had taught him to drive in the park, on the winding road that circled the reservoir. "The more room between you and the other fellow the better," his father said. "You don't know what he'll do. All you can do is stay as far away from him as possible." Henry had tried to pass along this wisdom to his own children, but they thought they knew everything from taking driver's ed. As a teenager, Kenny totaled their station wagon on black ice one New Year's Eve, breaking Tim Pickering's leg, while Margaret, coming home late from a party, took down a section of the Prentices' fence that Henry made her pay for. He'd hoped their accidents might teach them a lesson. He wasn't sure they had.<br>This time at Bryant he stopped at the sign. When he got home, he three-pointed the Olds at the end of the drive and backed it into the garage perfectly straight, waiting for the rear tires to kiss the two-by-four he'd rigged.<br>Emily was at the kitchen sink, peeling carrots.<br>"How was the post office?" she asked.<br>"Uneventful."<br>It was only as he was hanging up his keys that he remembered the wipers.</p><p>Hide-and-Seek</p><p>While Henry never considered his family rich, their house on Mellon Street, like many built in Highland Park around the turn of the century, had stained-glass windows on the stair landings and servants' quarters tucked beneath the eaves. By the time he was born, the servants were gone and the third floor given over to storage, the gas and water capped so that in winter frost rimed the inside of the panes. Here, among the dusty bassinets and rolled rugs, the banished lampshades and cast-off fashions from the Roaring Twenties, he and Arlene played house, making pretend meals in the kitchen, taking pretend baths in the tub. Queen Arlene ruled by divine right of being firstborn. According to her whim, they were mother and baby, or teacher and student, or husband and wife (this involved hugging and talking seriously across an imaginary dinner table), and sometimes they played a game in which she was the maid and he the butler, innocently replacing the rooms' former occupants. Eventually, no matter what the scenario, Henry lost interest, and Arlene would have to assuage him by agreeing to play his favorite game, hide-and-seek.<br>He liked hiding because he was good at it. When she was at school and there was nothing to do, he practiced on his own, fitting himself into steamer trunks and wicker hampers, crouching in the musty dark, listening to his heart and the skittering of mice. He could even squeeze himself into the oven if he took out the rack.<br>"I give up," Arlene called from the hallway. "Come out, come out, wherever you are. C'mon, Henry. I said I quit."<br>He waited until she went downstairs before reappearing. He knew better than to give away his best places.</p></p><h2>We Hold These Truths: Undertstanding the Ideas and Ideals of the Constitution</h2><p><b>[Library Edition Audiobook CD in vinyl case.]</b><br><br> [Read by Jeff Riggenbach]<br><br> Mortimer Adler has devoted a lifetime to studying the great ideas and explaining even the most difficult concepts to the average citizen, earning <i>Time</i> magazine's praise as ''a philosopher for everyman.'' In <i>We Hold These Truths</i>, Dr. Adler caps his life's work by illuminating the ideas and ideals that have made the United States of America a truly unique nation in the annals of history. <br><br> The ideas Adler examines include those at the core of the Declaration of Independence -- human equality, inalienable human rights, civil rights, the pursuit of happiness, and both the consent and dissent of the governed. These are the <b>ideas</b> that form the basis for the <b>ideals</b> found in the Preamble to the constitution that bind us together as a nation -- justice, domestic tranquillity, the common defense, the general welfare, and the blessings of liberty.</p><p>MORTIMER J. ADLER (1902-2001) served as the chairman of <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>'s board of editors, was the founder and director of the Institute for Philosophical Research, and was an honorary trustee and founder of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. He authored the well-known <i>How to Read a Book</i> and the intellectual autobiography <i>Philosopher at Large</i> and was coeditor, with Charles Van Doren, of <i>Great Treasury of Western Thought</i>, declared the Reference Book of 1977 by the American Library Association.We Hold These Truths is an exposition of the &#34;ideas and ideals&#34; embodied in three historical documents: the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the Gettysburg Address. By its own declaration, it is directed to the non-scholarly reader. Nonetheless, it&#39;s dry, wordy and pedantic. Furthermore, it&#39;s not designed to be read straight through; a significant portion is intended as supplementary reference material. It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone preferring to listen to, rather than read, such a book. However, Jeff Riggenbach manfully does his duty, plowing through it in a clear, pleasant voice with as much animation as the writing permits. J.N. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Laura Charlotte</h2><p>A mother describes her love for a toy elephant she was given as a child, a gift she has now passed on to her daughter</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- A warm, family-history story, temperamentally akin to Ehrlich's Zeek Silver Moon (Dial, 1972) or Jarrell's exquisite The Knee-Baby (Farrar, 1973). Laura, still awake in bed, asks her mother to tell her again the story of Charlotte, the stuffed elephant who links Mama's childhood with her own. Mama complies with pleasure, reliving her early life with Charlotte and her quiet joy in passing on a gift of love to her daughter. Laura knows just how the story goes, and prompts her mother with the telling, from Charlotte's first arrival as a birthday gift, through Mama's nighttime rescue of her lost elephant, to Laura's own welcome arrival and Charlotte's new place in her life. The story's simple declarations and sure details draw readers into an authentic shared familiarity. Cooper's pictures are endearing, filling the pages with photographlike re-creations of Mama's past and of the story's present. The twilight colors, rendered with high graininess, perfectly suit the moods of bedtime and of reminiscence. The conversations and the time shifts, while smoothly integrated, make this most comfortable for one-on-one sharing, but with the right reader, it would work well for story times, too. --Karen Litton, London Public Libraries, Ontario, Canada<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.A girl who is afraid to go to sleep asks for the familiar story of Charlotte, her handmade stuffed elephant. It is the mother's own story, and though it is late, she tells it to her daughter. When she was five, her grandmother made her an elephant out of sewing box scraps and she named it Charlotte, "the prettiest name in the world." There is some confusion about the generations--sometimes it's unclear just which grandmother is which--but Galbraith has written a gently reassuring story about the love that spans generations and is handed down with toys. It is also a tale of a girl getting older and outgrowing the need for a stuffed playmate and protector, but who nonetheless is saving it for her own child. Cooper's ( Grandpa's Face ) somber-toned illustrations envelop the reader in their warmth as they capture the mood of summer nights and cozy bedrooms.

When this chap's body is found floating in the river Skag, Hamish is the prime suspect.

Some holiday. Beaton has fine-tuned her MacBeth series into something altogether winning.

Living across the German border in Alsace-Lorraine, her family began taking in Jews who were fleeing the Nazis, as well as the Jewish children being sent away by terrified parents. Soon her own homeland was under Nazi rule, and she and her parents, brothers, and sisters were forced to live the restricted lives of all Jews.

The Art Deco movement, a great departure from Art Nouveau, surfaced in the early 20s, drawing influences from Futurism, Cubism, Neo-Classicism, and Egyptian and African Art. While Art Deco, flaunting excess and luxury, largely dominated the style of the 1920s, another new movement, Modernism, began to make itself known towards the end of the decade. For the first time, materials such as concrete, plate glass, and tubular metal were beginning to appear; following the dictum ""form follows function"", utilitarian simplicity and classic geometry were the Modernists' driving principles, as seen in the work of Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Ludwig Mies van de Rohe, to name a few.</p><p>Moving from the spirit of the Jazz Age to the cool simplicity of LeCorbusier's early ""machines for living"", Decorative Art 1920s is a fabulous tour through the groundbreaking innovations of interior design and architecture in the century's wildest decade.</p></p><p></p><h2>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1</h2><p>This essential tome details the common and uncommon creatures of the Old World.

Primarily known for her work in Egyptology, which was &#34;the core of her academic career,&#34; she is also known for her propagation of the Witch-cult hypothesis, the theory that the witch trials in the Early Modern period of Christianized Europe and North America were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Whilst this theory is today widely disputed and discredited by historians like Norman Cohn, Keith Thomas and Ronald Hutton, it has had a significant effect in the origins of Neopagan religions, primarily Wicca, a faith she supported. Her work in Egyptology took place largely alongside her mentor and friend, the archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie, whom she worked alongside at University College London. One of the earliest women to &#34;make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship,&#34; she was also an ardent feminist, being actively involved in the Suffragette movement.[2] From 1953 to 1955, she was the president of the Folklore Society, although since her death various members of the society have attempted to dissociate the organisation from her and the Murrayite theory of the Witch-Cult.</p><h2>Killing floor</h2><p>All is not well in Margrave, Georgia. The sleepy, forgotten town hasn&#39;t seen a crime in decades, but within the span of three days it witnesses events that leave everyone stunned. An unidentified man is found beaten and shot to death on a lonely country road. The police chief and his wife are butchered on a quiet Sunday morning. Then a bank executive disappears from his home, leaving his keys on the table and his wife frozen with fear. The easiest suspect is Jack Reacher - an outsider, a man just passing through. But Reacher is not just any drifter. He is a tough ex-military policeman, trained to think fast and act faster. He has lived with and hunted the worst: the hard men of the American military gone bad.</p><p>When Jack Reacher suddenly decides to ask a Greyhound bus driver to let him off near the town of Margrave, Georgia, he thinks it&#39;s because his brother once mentioned that the famed blues guitarist Blind Blake died there. But it doesn&#39;t take long for the footloose ex-military policeman to discover that there are plenty of strange--and very dangerous--things going on behind Margrave&#39;s manicured lawns and clean streets that demand his attention. This first thriller by a former television writer features some of the best-written scenes of action in recent memory, a crash course in currency and counterfeiting, and a hero who is just begging to be called on for an encore.The Bookcassetteï¿½ format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

But when the skies rain lightning and a long-forgotten city arises from the earth, he can seem like just another wizard.</p><p></p><h2>Bedford Square</h2><p>Readers in love with Anne Perry's matchless Victorian mysteries are no strangers to the scandals and secret corruption that sometimes lay concealed behind the elegant facades of the haughty mansions in fin de siï¿½cle London. For most Londoners, however, these great houses were inscrutable bastions of privilege and power.<br><br>All the more shocking then was the freshly dead body sprawled on the Bedford Square doorstep of General Brandon Ballantyne--an affront to every respectable sensibility.<br><br>The general denies all knowledge of the bloody-knuckled, shabbily dressed victim who has so rudely come to death outside his home. But Superintendent Thomas Pitt of Bow Street Police Station cannot believe him. For in the dead man's pocket he finds a rare snuffbox that recently graced the general's study. He must tread lightly, however, lest his investigation trigger a tragedy of immense proportions, ensnaring honorable men like flies in a web of terror. Pitt's clever wife, Charlotte, becomes his full partner in probing this masterpiece of evil, spawned by an amorality greater than they can imagine.<br><br>Like all Anne Perry novels, Bedford Square brings to vivid life a world of silver spoons and tattered rags, of men and women who embrace the best and the worst of human nature, where vicious lies become weapons of destruction--and dead men tell no tales.</p><p>Even if you prefer the tougher, edgier William Monk books by Anne Perry, such as <i>A Breach of Promise</i>, there's no denying the wealth of detail and the powerful emotions at work in her longer series of Victorian murder mysteries featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. The Pitt books effectively merge Henry James with Raymond Chandler: by having a middleclass policeman married to a socialite, Perry can probe both worlds, as she does in <i>Bedford Square</i>, a story of high-level blackmail and murder.<p> A famous historical scandal called the Tranby Croft affair (a gambling case involving the Prince of Wales) is very much in the news when the body of a working-class man is found early one morning on the posh doorstep of General Brandon Balantyne. No one in the house claims to know the murdered man, but he has a valuable piece of jewelry belonging to the Balantynes in his pocket. Thomas Pitt and his outspoken aide, Sergeant Tellman, must tread lightly, but Charlotte--and especially her sharp relative Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould--aren't restrained by such social niceties. Gracie, the Pitts' smart and rough-tongued maid, is also a valued asset to the investigation, which proceeds in a satisfying, if not particularly surprising, manner to a highly dramatic conclusion. </p><p> Other recent books in the Pitt series include <i>Brunswick Gardens</i>, <i>Ashworth Hall</i>, and <i>Pentecost Alley</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Among Anne Perry's other novels featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt are Brunswick Gardens, Ashworth Hall, Pentecost Alley, Traitors Gate, and The Hyde Park Headsman. She also writes the popular novels featuring Victorian private investigator William Monk--among them A Breach of Promise, The Silent Cry, Weighed in the Balance, Cain His Brother, and Defend and Betray. "Her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes," said the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Hundreds of thousands of readers agree.<br>Anne Perry lives in Scotland.</p><h2>A Porcupine Named Fluffy</h2><p>A porcupine named Fluffy is happier with his name after he meets a similarly misnamed rhinoceros.</p><p><p>Helen Lester and Lynn Munsinger have been together through thick and thin since first publishing <em>The Wizard, the Fairy, and the Magic Chicken</em> in 1983. They have collaborated on the hilarious Tacky the Penguin series and many other wildly funny and popular titles, including the award-winning <em>Hooway for Wodney Wat</em>. Helen Lester is a full-time writer who makes her home in New York, and Lynn Munsinger is a full-time illustrator living in Vermont.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 2 A rather slight story that is elevated by Munsinger's very funny full-color illustrations. After a singularly unfluffy porcupine named Fluffy fails to become what his name describes, he meets a fierce rhinoceros who sees the humor in his own name, Hippo. Of course, the two become fast friends and discover the truth in the saying, "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet." Munsinger's porcupines are as spiney and prickly as ever seen in a picture book to date, and Fluffy's unsuccessful guest for fluffiness is a spine-tickling way for young readers to learn that there are things about each of us that we cannot change no matter how hard we try. A solid addition to any picture book collection and one that will enliven a story hour.

They want to be able to mix grays, oranges, browns and violets of course, but first of all greens. <p>Our eyes are very sensitive to green and we can identify a vast range. Artists need access to this range if their work is to be at all realistic. Apart from a few standard premixed greens, the result is often very much trial and error. </p><p>This pocket sized book, in our 'Color Notes' series, offers the artist and craft worker instant access to a vast range of easily mixed, predictable greens. Using a simple step by step approach the reader is shown how to produce yellow-greens, blue-greens, bright, dull, vivid, opaque and transparent greens. Then how to make any of these lighter or darker. Not only is full information given on the mixing of the colors, but the book also offers a reference when seeking instant color guidance. Suitable for any media.</p></p><p>Michael Wilcox has a varied background, including periods as a professional artist, a conservator of art works and an engineer, which in turn led to a study of light physics in relation to the needs of the artist. His studies led to the book Blue and Yellow Don&#39;t Make Green. Published in Engish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean and Chinese, this book has changed the way that countless artists now mix and use their colours. This publication was followed by The Wilcox Guide to the Finest Watercolour Paints which has led to many of the changes in the pigments used in artists&#39; paints today. Specialist mixing palettes, workbooks and courses were then developed and the School of Colour was formed on an international basis.</p><h2>Tales of the City</h2><p>The acclaimed best-seller by the author of <i>Significant Other, Babycakes, </i>and <i>Sure of You </i>follows the experiences of Anna Madrigal, doyenne of 28 Barbary Lane.

From Europe come Christian visions of the soul&#39;s journey, the danses macabres, and imagery of mortal decay that recalls Tibetan practices.

In The Essence of Religion Feuerbach applied the analysis expounded in The Essence of Christianity (1841) to religion as a whole. The main thrust of Feuerbach&#39;s argument is aptly summed up in the original subtitle to this work: &#34;God the Image of Man. Man&#39;s Dependence upon Nature the Last and Only Source of Religion.&#34; Feuerbach reviews key aspects of religious belief and in each case explains them as imaginative elaborations of the primal awe and sense of dependence that humans experience in the face of nature&#39;s power and mystery. Rather than humans being created in the image of God, the situation is quite the reverse: &#34;All theology is anthropology,&#34; he says, and &#34;the being whom man sets over against himself as a separate supernatural existence is his own being.&#34;Feuerbach goes on to argue that the attributes of God are no more than reflections of the various needs of human nature. Further, as human civilization has advanced, the role of God has gradually diminished. In ancient times, before human beings had any scientific understanding of the way nature works, divine powers were seen behind every natural manifestation, from lightning bolts to the change of seasons. By contrast, in the modern era, when an in-depth understanding of natural causes has been achieved, there is no longer any need to imagine God behind the workings of nature: &#34;He who for his God has no other material than that which natural science, philosophy, or natural observation generally furnishes to him . . . ought to be honest enough also to abstain from using the name of God, for a natural principle is always a natural essence and not what constitutes the idea of a God.&#34;Feuerbach&#39;s naturalistic philosophy had a decisive influence on Karl Marx and radical theologians such as Bruno Bauer and David Friedrich Strauss. His incisive critique remains a challenge to religion to this day.</p><p><b>Ludwig Feuerbach</b>&nbsp;(1804-1872) was a highly respected nineteenth-century philosopher who focused on the study of post-Hegelian philosophy, idealism, naturalism, materialism, and positivism. Feuerbach&#x2019;s book,&nbsp;<i>The Essence of Christianity,&nbsp;</i>is noted as an influential atheist text, and helped inspire the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Feuerbach was educated at the University of Berlin.</p><h2>Pierre Deux&#39;s Paris Country: A Style and Source Book of the Ile-De-France, Linda Dannenberg</h2><p>Internationally recognized as the leading chroniclers of the French Country Look, the Pierre Deux team now turns its attention to Paris and its surrounding province. <b>450 full-color and 24 black-and-white photographs.</b></p><p>lly recognized as the leading chroniclers of the French Country Look, the Pierre Deux team now turns its attention to Paris and its surrounding province. <b>450 full-color and 24 black-and-white photographs.</b></p><h2>What&#39;s In The Bible The Story Of God Through Time And Eternity</h2><p>A collaboration between the renowned theologian and the bestselling author provides readers with a sweeping survey of the bible, highlighting important theological precepts and Divine truths.</p><p><p>Dr. R.C.

It argues that we pay far too little attention to some of the other great satisfactions of life - work and creativity.

From the great to the obscure, Storr examines the uses that all kinds of people make of solitude in times of bereavement and depression, in escaping from the pressures of daily life, in communing with a higher power through prayer, and in finding and expressing their deepest selves.The editor, Anthony Storr, is a doctor, psychiatrist and analyst (trained in the school of C.G.) and author of &#39;Jung&#39; (a Fontana Modern Master,1973) amongst many others.</p><h2>Platypus</h2><p><b>Meet the puzzling platypus!

So with the house quiet that morning&#x2014;Sam off meeting with some local businessmen, Lillian at the grocery store, Lloyd in school, and me with time on my hands&#x2014;taking stock was exactly what I was doing.</p><p>Now, I&#x2019;m not talking about counting up assets and debits in a portfolio&#x2014;I let Binkie, my curly-headed lawyer, take care of that&#x2014;but rather, totting up the pluses and minuses of my life while hoping that they&#x2019;ll balance out in the final accounting. Admittedly, I have a lot of pluses: Lloyd, Sam, Lillian, Hazel Marie. I could go on and on, but I also have a lot of minuses, like stubbornness, self-centeredness, a tendency to jump into the problems of other people&#x2014;all for their own good, but still&#x2014;and a certain impetuosity when action is called for.</p><p>I would like to report that, at the time of which I speak, I dwelt on the pluses and how thankful I was for them, but I didn&#x2019;t. I was in a critical frame of mind, and all I could think of were the numerous times that I&#x2019;d overstepped myself, blithely confident that I knew best and acting on that certainty.</p><p>Even as I inwardly cringed at the remembrance of some of my rasher moments, I could also comfort myself with the fact that only a few of them had actually made things worse. I will concede, however, that my recollections can on occasion be a tiny bit selective. But that in itself is a gift, an asset if you will, for who among us could live with our character defects constantly in the forefront?</p><p>I know I couldn&#x2019;t face a day with mine uppermost in mind. I have to keep them safely stored in a mental box, opening it only when I feel the need to take stock, then quickly storing them away again.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d been doing the morning after Sam had told me in no uncertain terms that he was tired of taking trips by himself and that, furthermore, he had no intention of giving up his trips. In other words, he meant for me to go with him, and right there I had to add another minus to my debit list: I was too self-centered to put his desires above my own, but I&#x2019;ll tell you the truth, I did not want to go traipsing all over the world.</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;d love it, Julia,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Think of all the places we could go&#x2014;Ireland, for example. Wouldn&#x2019;t you like to go there? Or we could do a cathedral tour in Europe or a tour of the great houses of England. Or what about Rome or Paris?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and what would we have when we got back? Aching feet and a bunch of pictures with nowhere to put them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Memories, honey. We&#x2019;d have memories, and we wouldn&#x2019;t have to take any pictures.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I should say not,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The thought of walking all over creation with a camera around my neck is not my idea of fun. Besides,&#x201d; I went on, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We wouldn&#x2019;t have to fly. We could go by boat. You&#x2019;d like it if we went first class&#x2014;dressing for dinner, strolling on the deck, meeting interesting people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And suffering from seasickness the whole way, too. Oh, Sam,&#x201d; I said, immediately contrite at the disappointed look on his face, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. It&#x2019;s just that I have no desire to see the world. I like it right here, doing the same things every day. The daily routine ressures me, while constant change disturbs my equilibrium. But I know you love to travel and I wouldn&#x2019;t discourage you from it for anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know you wouldn&#x2019;t, but I&#x2019;d enjoy it so much more if you were enjoying it with me. And I think you would, if you&#x2019;d just try it. We could start with a few short trips to get you used to being away. We could take the Amtrak Crescent to New Orleans, for instance, or take it the other way and go to New York. See some Broadway shows, go to museums, do a little shopping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting closer,&#x201d; I said with a smile to show I was teasing. &#x201c;What about a Sunday afternoon drive? Wouldn&#x2019;t that suffice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And see what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;re waterfalls around and fruit stands and motorcycle convoys. Maybe a fireworks stand. And we&#x2019;d be home by dark.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam laughed. &#x201c;You just don&#x2019;t want to leave home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I like it here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I like to travel and I&#x2019;d really like you to go with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it.&#x201d;</p><p>That had been the end of the conversation, but I knew it wasn&#x2019;t the end of the matter. But, I declare, I didn&#x2019;t want to take off for parts unknown and leave the people who might need me. Why, what would happen to Lloyd without me around to watch over him? And what if Hazel Marie needed help with her twin babies? And what would Lillian do if trouble descended on her or Latisha, her great-granddaughter? To say nothing of the Abbotsville First Presbyterian Church. If I were gone any length of time, there was no telling what Pastor Ledbetter would get in his mind to do. He might change the order of worship again&#x2014;something that he seemed to do just to keep us off balance. Or to keep us awake, but who knew?</p><p>The last time I&#x2019;d been out of town for a few days&#x2014;the time I chased jewel thieves all the way to Florida&#x2014;you wouldn&#x2019;t believe what had happened while I was gone. I&#x2019;d been elected treasurer of the garden club, president of the Lila Mae Harding Sunday school class, and leader of the book club for a whole year. And on top of that, I&#x2019;d been volunteered to host a Christmas tea and to help with Vacation Bible school the following summer.</p><p>No, it wasn&#x2019;t safe to leave town. I needed to stick around to protect myself. Sam, of course, didn&#x2019;t have that problem. If he returned from abroad or wherever and found himself in an office he didn&#x2019;t want, he&#x2019;d just smile and say, &#x201c;Thank you all the same, but I think I&#x2019;ll pass on that.&#x201d; And he&#x2019;d stick to it, whereas I would be so riddled with guilt for turning down an elected honor that I&#x2019;d accept it and hate every minute of it.</p><p>So the days and weeks passed with no further mention of the wonders of travel while I put aside my stock taking since I couldn&#x2019;t remedy or rectify any lapses of the past anyway. I noticed, however, a few travel brochures left lying around the house&#x2014;on the hall table, for one, in the kitchen by the phone, and even next to the sink in our bathroom. It seemed that Sam had in mind a boat trip down the Rhine&#x2014;or up it, depending on which way it flowed. And all I could think of was how could he expect us to spend a week or more on the high seas just to get to the Rhine, then spend more time on water once we got there.</p><p>Looking back now, though, I should&#x2019;ve jumped at the chance to fill our summer with a globe-trotting trip. I should&#x2019;ve realized that my husband&#x2019;s inquiring mind would not be content without something new and intriguing to occupy it, but I made no mention of the brochures nor did I ask about Sam&#x2019;s plans. I just let things ride while hoping that his wanderlust would wear itself out or, if it didn&#x2019;t, that he&#x2019;d get over wanting me along. Neither happened, but a few things came up that took their place, and I&#x2019;m still not sure which would&#x2019;ve been for the best.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&#x201c;Julia,&#x201d; Sam said with a little smile pulling at the corners of his mouth as he snapped open the newspaper, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided not to take a trip this summer. It looks to be so busy that I won&#x2019;t have time to get away.&#x201d; This was on an evening a few weeks later while we relaxed by the fire in our new library at the end of a blustery day in February.</p><p>I looked at him in the other wing chair, taking note of his carefully averted eyes, and knew that something was afoot. &#x201c;Is that right,&#x201d; I responded. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be glad to have you home. What changed your mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve just realized that there&#x2019;re a lot of interesting things to do closer to home. I don&#x2019;t have to go halfway around the world to keep myself entertained.&#x201d;</p><p>He was being entirely too noncommittal, deliberately holding back on something.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not planning a camping trip in Pisgah Forest, are you? Because if you are, I don&#x2019;t sleep on cots or in tents.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;Not my cup of tea either.&#x201d; Then he made a great show of concentrating on an article in the paper&#x2014;a patent attempt to engage my curiosity.</p><p>&#x201c;May I ask what it is you&#x2019;ve found that&#x2019;ll keep you too busy to float down the Rhine? And, yes, I&#x2019;ve noticed all the brochures you&#x2019;ve left lying around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thought you would,&#x201d; he said without looking my way. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t tempt you, did they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Then waited to hear what he&#x2019;d come up with to replace his travel plans. And kept waiting, while he read the want ads, the sports page, the editorials, a columnist with whom I knew he didn&#x2019;t agree, and the letters to the editor. At this point, I realized that I had another character defect that would go on my list of minuses the next time I decided to take stock: lack of patience.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I demanded. &#x201c;What is it? What do you have up your sleeve that you&#x2019;re dying to tell me about, but not before I have to drag it out of you?&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned and pursed his mouth, as if he were giving it some deep thought. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s like this. It might involve a little travel&#x2014;not far&#x2014;just around a couple of counties, as you suggested, but still you might not be interested. I can probably handle it by myself, but if not, there&#x2019;ll be plenty of volunteers to help out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For what? I never heard of having volunteers to travel around a few counties. And who would volunteer, anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, a lot of folks, all eager to do whatever I want. I&#x2019;ll have my pick, but don&#x2019;t worry. No overnight trips as far as I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; I said, thinking that I&#x2019;d figured out his plans. &#x201c;Sounds as if you&#x2019;ve found some fishing buddies. You&#x2019;ll be floating around on water even if it&#x2019;s not the Rhine, and you&#x2019;ll probably catch more, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope, won&#x2019;t be any time for fishing. The French Broad and Mud Creek will have to do without me this year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sam Murdoch,&#x201d; I said, fully aroused by this time, &#x201c;put down that paper and tell me what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>He lowered the paper, smiled at me, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided that you&#x2019;re right&#x2014;home is where I want to be, too. So tell me, how would you like to be the state senator&#x2019;s wife?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Jimmy Ray Mooney&#x2019;s?</i> Sam, he&#x2019;s married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So are you,&#x201d; he pointed out, laughing at the shock on my face. &#x201c;But no, you won&#x2019;t have to change husbands. The one you already have has been asked to run for the senate of the North Carolina General Assembly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The state senate,&#x201d; I murmured, as if it was a new concept, which it was. &#x201c;In Raleigh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where else?&#x201d; Sam asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess I&#x2019;m just surprised,&#x201d; I said, running over all the ramifications in my mind. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know you had political ambitions. How long have you been thinking about this?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at his watch. &#x201c;About two hours,&#x201d; he said with a straight face. Then he put aside the paper to give me his full attention. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what happened: I was approached about running several weeks ago, but I had my heart set on taking a trip with you this summer. So I turned it down, but then Frank Sawyer had to drop out&#x2014;you heard about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He had a double knee replacement, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, and not doing very well, I understand. The party was counting on him to run against Jimmy Ray again, but he&#x2019;s not up for campaigning all spring and summer. Look, Julia,&#x201d; Sam said, leaning forward, &#x201c;the deadline for filing is at the end of this week, so if you have any hesitation about this, tell me now. I&#x2019;ll turn it down with no regrets. In fact, it&#x2019;d give me a good excuse to go fishing instead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I guess that&#x2019;s better than going down the Rhine, but I don&#x2019;t know, Sam. You&#x2019;re not giving me a whole lot of time to think. Would we have to move to Raleigh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. The Assembly is in session only a few months a year. We could get a small apartment there, and you could go with me or I&#x2019;d come home every weekend. They close up shop on Thursdays, so we&#x2019;d have three-day weekends at home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long drive, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About four and a half to five hours.&#x201d; He raised his eyebrows and smiled. &#x201c;Depending on how often we stopped.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled back. I didn&#x2019;t let many rest areas go by without dropping in. Then I gazed into the fire for a while, thinking over what a political campaign might mean to our comfortable way of life. Then I looked up at him and said, &#x201c;This may sound as if I&#x2019;m trying to talk you out of it, but I&#x2019;m not. I just want to know what we&#x2019;d be getting ourselves into. You&#x2019;ve retired from practicing law, do you really want to take on another job? And what about your book&#x2014;the one you&#x2019;ve worked on so long? Would you just put that aside?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As for taking on another job, the beauty part of this is that I would be a one-term senator&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve made that clear. The party is grooming an up-and-comer, but he&#x2019;s too green this year. In two years in the next election he&#x2019;ll be ready or Sawyer will be healthy enough to run again. Frank knew he was having surgery, but he assured the party he&#x2019;d be able to run, but, well.&#x201d; Sam stopped and chuckled. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t take into account some complications he&#x2019;s having. I understand he&#x2019;s cussing his surgeon up one side and down the other. Fact of the matter is, Julia, I&#x2019;d be a stopgap, which is fine with me. Two years of politicking is enough, and besides, it&#x2019;ll give me more material for my book.&#x201d;</p><p>The book of which we spoke was a history of Abbot County&#x2019;s legal community&#x2014;the lawyers, judges, defendants, and so on&#x2014;which Sam had been working on during his retirement.</p><p>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; he went on, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re against it, I won&#x2019;t do it. The only reason I&#x2019;m even considering it is because I&#x2019;m a firm believer in the two-party system. To let Jimmy Ray run unopposed goes against the grain. He&#x2019;s been in the senate long enough.&#x201d; Sam stopped and thought for a minute. &#x201c;And there is this: I may have no choice. I might not win.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said, waving my hand to brush that possibility aside, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll win, all right. Everybody knows you and respects you. I have no doubt you&#x2019;d win.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed again. &#x201c;Thanks, but I&#x2019;m not so sure. There&#x2019;s an ingrained group that&#x2019;s controlled this district, county, and town for years&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a tight network of old hands, except they&#x2019;ve been careful to bring in newcomers so that the same faces don&#x2019;t appear over and over. But they know what they&#x2019;re doing. They pretty much stack the town council, then they take turns standing for mayor. And they do pretty much the same with state and federal offices&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s such a blow to lose Frank Sawyer. He was the best one to take on Mooney. He almost beat him two years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;d be running against Jimmy Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right, and he&#x2019;ll be hard to beat with that crowd behind him.&#x201d;</p><p>As I thought this over, I realized that a lot of underhanded things must&#x2019;ve been going on that I&#x2014;and a lot of others&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t known about.</p><p>&#x201c;That just burns me up,&#x201d; I said, somewhat hotly. &#x201c;Do you mean to tell me that our elections have all been rigged for years?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not rigged exactly, no,&#x201d; Sam said, shaking his head. &#x201c;Just that they&#x2019;ve been able to preselect the candidates who run, and with this district being mostly a one-party district, voters have little choice. And they put up enough new names now and then to give the appearance of...</p></p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub, Volume 17: The Will of the Fang</h2><p>The epic journey of Ogami Itto and Daigoro continues in this stunning volume!

Sometimes they come when I first lie down to sleep; other times I wake up with an idea racing through my mind. But regardless of when an idea comes, I have made it a habit to get out of bed and write the idea down before it disappears into my dreams. You should do the same.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve also made it a habit not to disturb the Redhead if I can possibly help it, and that night was no exception. I quietly slid out of bed and hurried toward my office, which is across the hall and to the right of the head of the staircase. As usual, I did not turn on a light. I had traveled that particular path thousands of times in the twenty-two years we&#x2019;d lived in our home. However, in all those years I had never accidentally put my left foot down where the second floor ended and the first step down our staircase began! Let&#x2019;s just say that misstep more than disturbed the Redhead!<br> <br>Most of what I am writing at this point is information my family filled me in on after the accident. Since I was unconscious for several minutes, I have absolutely no recall of what happened after I fell, but from what the Redhead tells me, she grabbed the phone and dialed 911 as soon as she realized I was tumbling down the stairs. An ambulance was dispatched, and help was at the house within a few minutes of my fall.<br> <br><b>&#x201c;The Call&#x201d;</b><br> <br>While the paramedics attended to me, the Redhead called our children. By then it was about 10:30 p.m., so seeing our name come up on caller ID at that hour struck fear into our children&#x2019;s hearts. And this time, I&#x2019;m sorry to say, their fear was not unfounded. My son, Tom, refers to that night as the night he got &#x201c;the call.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m quite sure each of you has had &#x201c;the call&#x201d; at one time or another and can relate to what our children were experiencing. I&#x2019;m grateful that all three of them, including Tom who was out of town, hurried to the hospital to help their &#x201c;elderly parents&#x201d;&#x2014;that is what I call us when I&#x2019;m about half-teasing and half-relieved that our kids are hovering around us, willing and eager to help.<br> <br>Over the next several hours it became apparent that my left side took the brunt of my fall. When I landed at the bottom of the stairs, I hit my head on the marble floor and then slammed it against the front door. Please don&#x2019;t ask for a reenactment&#x2014;you get the picture! I had to spend a few nights at the hospital so the doctors could monitor the two areas where my brain had a bleed, and I needed some time to get used to the positional vertigo that I began to experience about twelve hours after I fell. Amazingly, I suffered no broken bones, but I can testify that I was one sore and dizzy guy!<br> <br>What we didn&#x2019;t know when I finally left the hospital was how seriously my short-term memory had been affected. Sometimes it is nice to be a little clueless. Everyone in the family has had ample time to adjust to the fact that my short-term memory is very, very, short. Now we are all learning how to live with that fact.<br> <br>Life <i>is</i> change. On March 7, 2007, my life changed completely with one, simple, misplaced step. Some would say it changed for the worse, and by human standards they would be entirely right. Fortunately, and I can assure you this is not by chance, the one verse that I&#x2019;ve written in the majority of books I&#x2019;ve been asked to autograph, the verse that I believe encourages people most in the midst of their troubles, Romans 8:28, &#x201c;We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose&#x201d; (KJV), is the verse that allows me to know that God will use this season of my life, difficult though it may be, for His glory and my ultimate benefit.<br> <br>By human standards my fall down the stairs and the vertigo and the brain injury that resulted in my short-term memory loss would seem to dictate an end to my long and much-loved career, but I&#x2019;m here to tell you that, even with its problems, my life is more inspiring, more intriguing, and more fulfilling than ever. For me, when life does take an unexpected turn, it is somewhat like taking a hike on a new trail; I can&#x2019;t wait to see what is around the next bend. If the going gets really rocky, I might start hoping smoother ground is just ahead or that I&#x2019;m close to the end of the trail where I can take a long desired break from the grueling journey. But my enthusiastic expectation for what is yet to come, for what God has planned for me and my life, never wavers. I trust Him.<br> <br>I also trust my family. Many years ago I told my family that I was concerned that I might not realize it myself if I started to lose my edge and my speeches were no longer as effective as they should be. I did not want to embarrass myself, so I asked them to promise that they would tell me if they ever thought it was time for me to step down from the stage. As I got older and started experiencing some of what I&#x2019;d call the usual memory loss that happens when we pass the ages of fifty, sixty, and then seventy, the children often checked on me to be sure I was still able to deliver. Thankfully, they were discreet, and until after the accident I didn&#x2019;t even know they had already begun checking me out periodically. They took their assignment seriously, and I&#x2019;m glad they did.<br> <br>It is true that as I neared the age of eighty, I began to rely on notes to help me keep my place as I was speaking. But I figured that most folks rely on notes by the time they are eighty, so I wasn&#x2019;t at all concerned about how my audience would perceive my occasional pass by the podium to reference my outline. My daughter Julie reviewed the DVD of the Get Motivated Seminar engagement I did in San Bernardino, California, on March 6, 2007, the day before my accident, and she assures me that I was still completely stageworthy at that point. Unfortunately, my brain injury had such a profound effect on my short-term memory that the ability to reference an outline was beyond me. I could look at the outline, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last point that I had made. To add insult to injury, the vertigo I was experiencing made it virtually impossible for me to even walk around the stage safely.<br> <br><b>The Dilemma</b><br> <br>Obviously, I had a real dilemma. I book engagements months and years in advance, and there were several engagements pending when I fell. I know companies and individuals alike are negatively impacted if I can&#x2019;t keep an engagement, so I have always done everything in my power to be where I&#x2019;m expected. I&#x2019;ve sometimes missed the funerals of my siblings and friends, and I&#x2019;ve spoken when I probably should not have due to illness, but I always felt like my responsibility to show up according to plan was paramount. I can still hear my mother saying, &#x201c;If a man&#x2019;s word is no good&#x2014;he is no good.&#x201d; I had given my word.<br> <br>Situations like the one I was in create circumstances that make a fellow really grateful to have good family relationships. I knew I could count on the help of my family, and I got it in spades! The Redhead, Tom, Cindy, and Julie enlisted the help of my doctors who were working with me after my accident, as well as the help of my friends and associates, to determine if I should find a way to continue speaking or stay home and concentrate on my writing.<br> <br>My family was open to seeing how I would progress, but they were concerned about the very real possibility that my vertigo might cause another fall and that traveling would put me in more vulnerable positions than staying close to home would. When they discussed the idea that it might be time for me to retire from public speaking, it was quickly followed by a concern that God might not be done with using me on the stage, and none of them wanted to be responsible for suggesting I stop if that was, in fact, the case. However, it was crystal clear that short of an outright miracle I would not be giving the kinds of speeches my audiences had come to expect.<br> <br>The doctors had said that I might recover more of my short-term memory with time as my brain healed, but they couldn&#x2019;t be sure what the ultimate outcome would be. More than two years have passed since my fall, and it seems that I have good days and other days. (You know there are no bad days. After all, some people didn&#x2019;t wake up today, so compared to them, I&#x2019;m having a better-than-good day!) Since I am over eighty years of age, we are taking the conservative approach to my medical options. We&#x2019;re taking our time and applying the good old Ben Franklin approach I&#x2019;ve taught all these years: divide a page from top to bottom, put positive benefits of procedures/therapies in one column and possible negative outcomes in the other, and we&#x2019;ll let the obvious, as well as prayer, determine our decisions.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll go into more detail later about some of the therapies, supplements, exercises, and medical treatments friends and even clients have suggested and that we&#x2019;ve tried, but for now I want you to know that we&#x2019;ve never stopped looking at possible treatments for what ails me. We pray about the treatments and supplements we are told about, and if we feel God is leading me to try them, I try them. My doctors remain supportive and encouraging about the possibilities the future holds.<br> <br>My associates, particularly those who also speak on public platforms, were and still are concerned about my retaining my dignity and going out on top. The thought of me&#x2014;in many cases their mentor&#x2014;performing differently and faltering here and there before an audience is almost unthinkable. I love them for wanting to help me be remembered as I was before the accident. And I love them for personally helping me move ahead, to do what God puts in front of me to the best of my ability.<br> <br><b>The Immediate Solution</b><br> <br>Thankfully, the only speaking engagement I had to miss immediately after my fall was for my friends and business associates Peter and Tamara Lowe at one of their big Get Motivated Seminars in Houston, Texas, on March 13, 2007. After a lot of in-depth examination by no less than five doctors, it was determined that I had retained almost all of the information I have taught over my many years as a speaker and author, and that I was totally &#x201c;present&#x201d; when being spoken to. The only new memory problem I had was with the most immediate short term. When questioned, I could answer without any hesitation; but if you asked me what you had asked me when I finished answering the question, I could not tell you. Yes, my memory about current events is that short! (You&#x2019;re probably wondering how this book got written, and I&#x2019;ll tell you&#x2014;we are both the beneficiaries of the good help I have. Between my executive assistant, Laurie Magers, my editor/daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, and others on my staff, we got it done!)<br> <br>Since I could recall information when asked, Peter Lowe came up with the idea of changing my speaking format. For years I have been known for my energetic, highly physical speaking style. Some people have even accused me of being more than enthusiastic during presentations. I liked to somewhat live out the stories while I was telling them, and I thought standing stock still behind a podium might block or slow down the words that came flying out of my mouth at the rate of 250 per minute with gusts up to 450. You would naturally assume that it was my vertigo that put an end to all my physical on-stage activity, but it really had more to do with the fact that we couldn&#x2019;t find anyone who felt comfortable chasing me around the stage to ask the next question in our new interview format! Sorry, I couldn&#x2019;t contain myself.<br> <br>Sitting down for one-on-one interviews on stage came about through a combination of my being unsteady on my feet and my mind&#x2019;s not keeping track of what I&#x2019;d already said. Peter Lowe interviewed me for the first time in Boise, Idaho, on March 27, 2007, just twenty days after my fall, but after a few engagements it occurred to him that my associates, Bryan Flanagan and Krish Dhanam, both having shared the Get Motivated Seminar platforms with me on many occasions, might be a better fit for the interviewer role. They have both taught my material, and they&#x2019;ve studied it in order to apply it to their lives. They can tell most of my stories almost word for word, and in the event I had trouble recalling any answer to their questions, they could help out by prompting me toward the answer or outright supplying the answer if it still eluded me. It made perfect sense to ask them to interview me at the Get Motivated Seminars. Fortunately, they both agreed, and with great faith we pressed forward to keep my commitments.<br> <br><b>Love and Honor</b><br> <br>Both Krish and Bryan did an excellent job of interviewing me on stage. They carefully laid out their questions so that we could cover several different areas of interest, such as the mental, physical, spiritual, financial, and relational sides of life. Their goal and mine was to continue to give the audience valuable, applicable, life-improving information in an entertaining way.<br> <br>I cannot express fully the gratitude I have for these two men. Engagement after engagement, they tweaked their questions as they learned better how to deal with my short-term memory. They spent hours and hours working on how to make me look my very best. They learned how to highlight the good and minimize the imperfections that were bound to show with the kind of brain injury I suffered.<br> <br>We continued on this course with the public seminars, but we had to address what we, as a company, would do about my corporate engagements and about my two-day Born to Win (BTW) seminar that I had hosted since the 1970s. Tom was the president of our company at that time (now he is the CEO), and I sorely wish that all the weight of this problem hadn&#x2019;t fallen squarely on his shoulders, but he handled and continues to handle the business beautifully.<br> <br>Tom decided that we&#x2019;d notify the corporations I was scheduled to speak for about my accident and the change to an interview format and let them decide if they wanted to keep their engagements or cancel. He also decided that we would not book any more corporate events for the foreseeable future and that we would promote the upcoming Born to Win seminar as the final one.<br> <br><b>The Last Born to Win Seminar</b><br> <br>I know rock stars have farewell tours, sometimes every four or five years, but I had never considered that I might actually &#x201c;plan&#x201d; to do any of the things I do for the last time. I&#x2019;ve always figured I&#x2019;ll die while I&#x2019;m still doing what I love doing. When folks say they&#x2019;ve heard I&#x2019;m retired, I say with mock surprise, &#x201c;Retired! Friend, you weren&#x2019;t listening! I said I was reFIRED! I&#x2019;m not gonna ease up, shut up, let up, or give up until I&#x2019;m taken up! Matter of fact, I&#x2019;m just getting warmed up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Some people might think that&#x2019;s reaching a little far for a man who has celebrated the sixty-first anniversary of his twenty-first birthday. (For those of you who are mathematically challenged, that means I&#x2019;m eighty-two years old.) But I am truly the kind of guy who goes after Moby-Dick in a rowboat and takes the tartar sauce with him! Which will help you understand that it was with a bit of trepidation that I agreed to the &#x201c;last&#x201d; Born to Win seminar.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t long before I understood why rock stars have so many farewell tours. They sell out&#x2014;fast! I was overwhelmed at the immediate response to the announcement. Many who attended Born to Win did so several times through the years. Some brought their employees; others came with their whole families in tow. Larry Carpenter particularly stands out in my mind. He attended forty-five times over twenty-seven consecutive years. His beautiful wife, Lisa, and their three sons participated more times than I ...</p><h2>Shootout of the Mountain Man</h2><p><b>Invitation To A Hanging</b><br><br> They're hanging Billy Ray Cabot in Cloverdale, Nevada on Friday.

By midnight, Smoke and Billy Ray are riding hell-for-leather out of Cloverdale, and into a war between cunning railroad robbers and the organization sworn to stop them.

But this time she&#39;s really in trouble. The People&#39;s Republic of Haven has finally found an admiral who can win battles, and Honor&#39;s orders take her straight into an ambush. Outnumbered, outgunned, and unable to run, she has just two options: see the people under her command die in a hopeless, futile battle...or surrender them - and herself - to the Peeps. There can be only one choice, and at least the People&#39;s Navy promises to treat their prisoners honorably.

This is the 2,500-year-old good news contained in the <i>Anapanasati Sutra, </i> the Buddha's own teaching on cultivating both tranquility and deep insight through the full awareness of breathing. In this book, Larry Rosenberg brings this timeless meditation method to life for people today, using the insights gained from his many years of practice and teaching. With wisdom, compassion, and humor he shows how the practice of breath awareness is quietly, profoundly transformative&#x2014;and also supremely practical: if you're breathing, you've already got everything you need to start.</p><p>In any meditation class, one of the first things one learns is the importance of breathing. For Larry Rosenberg, a seasoned instructor of insight meditation, the breath is everything. And he's not in bad company since the Buddha himself delivered a sutra on the subject. Rosenberg's <i>Breath by Breath</i> is an elaboration on this short classic but couched in familiar language, liberally spiced with anecdotes from Rosenberg's decades of practice and teaching. It's Rosenberg's earthy humor and patient instruction that make him such a popular teacher and that make <i>Breath by Breath</i> a rewarding read. He takes the beginning student from the wandering "doggy mind" to becoming a chicken, along the way getting a teacher's bite and sitting like a frog. For the hurried and harried, he includes a nutshell, two-step version of the sutra's 16-step practice (appended in the full text of the sutra). More of a coach than a disciplinarian, Rosenberg takes a see-what-happens attitude. "You don't make liberation happen," he says. "To contemplate breathing is to contemplate life itself." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Larry Rosenberg is founder and resident teacher of the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a guiding teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Paul On Trial The Book Of Acts As A Defense Of Christianity</h2><p><p>JOHN W.

With the ease and skill of a master storyteller, Thien takes us inside an extended family in China, showing us the lives of two successive generations--those who lived through Mao's Cultural Revolution in the mid-twentieth century; and the children of the survivors, who became the students protesting in Tiananmen Square in 1989, in one of the most important political moments of the past century. With exquisite writing sharpened by a surprising vein of wit and sly humour, Thien has crafted unforgettable characters who are by turns flinty and headstrong, dreamy and tender, foolish and wise. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the centre of this epic tale, as capacious and mysterious as life itself, are enigmatic Sparrow, a genius composer who wishes desperately to create music yet can find truth only in silence; his mother and aunt, Big Mother Knife and Swirl, survivors with captivating singing voices and an unbreakable bond; Sparrow's ethereal cousin Zhuli, daughter of Swirl and storyteller Wen the Dreamer, who as a child witnesses the denunciation of her parents and as a young woman becomes the target of denunciations herself; and headstrong, talented Kai, best friend of Sparrow and Zhuli, and a determinedly successful musician who is a virtuoso at masking his true self until the day he can hide no longer. Here, too, is Kai's daughter, the ever-questioning mathematician Marie, who pieces together the tale of her fractured family in present-day Vancouver, seeking a fragile meaning in the layers of their collective story.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With maturity and sophistication, humour and beauty, a huge heart and impressive understanding, Thien has crafted a novel that is at once beautifully intimate and grandly political, rooted in the details of daily life inside China, yet transcendent in its universality.</p><p>Madeleine Thien is the author of the story collection <i>Simple Recipes</i>, which was a finalist for the Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize, a Kiriyama Pacific Prize Notable Book, and won the BC Book Prize for Fiction; the novel <i>Certainty</i>, which won the Amazon.ca First Novel Award; and the novel <i>Dogs at the Perimeter</i>, which was shortlisted for Berlin&#x2019;s 2014 International Literature Award and won the Frankfurt Book Fair&#x2019;s 2015 Liberaturpreis.

The daughter of Malaysian-Chinese immigrants to Canada, she lives in Montreal.On the 16th of December, 1990, Ma came home in a taxi with a new daughter who wore no coat, only a thick scarf, a woollen sweater, blue jeans and canvas shoes. I had never met a Chinese girl before, that is, one who, like my father, came from real mainland China. A pair of grey mittens dangled from a string around her neck and swayed in nervous rhythm against her legs. The fringed ends of her blue scarf fell one in front and one behind, like a scholar. The rain was falling hard, and she walked with her head down, holding a medium-sized suitcase that appeared to be empty. She was pale and her hair had the gleam of the sea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casually I opened the door and widened my eyes as if I was not expecting visitors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Girl," Ma said. "Take the suitcase. Hurry up."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai-ming stepped inside and paused on the edge of the doormat. When I reached for the suitcase, my hand accidentally touched hers, but she didn&#x2019;t draw back. Instead, her other hand reached out and lightly covered mine. She gazed right at me, with such openness and curiosity that, out of shyness, I closed my eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai-ming," Ma was saying. "Let me introduce you. This is my Girl."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled away and opened my eyes again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma, taking off her coat, glanced first at me and then at the room. The brown sofa with its three camel-coloured stripes had seen better days, but I had spruced it up with all the flowery pillows and stuffed animals from my bed. I had also turned on the television in order to give this room the appearance of liveliness. Ma nodded vigorously at me. "Girl, greet your aunt."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, it&#x2019;s okay if you call me Ai-ming. Please. I really, mmm, prefer it."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To placate them both, I said, "Hello."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as I suspected, the suitcase was very light. With my free hand, I moved to take Ai-ming&#x2019;s coat, remembering too late she didn&#x2019;t have one. My arm wavered in the air like a question mark. She reached out, grasped my hand and firmly shook it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a question in her eyes. Her hair, pinned back on one side, fell loosely on the other, so that she seemed forever in profile, about to turn towards me. Without letting go of my hand, she manoeuvred her shoes noiselessly off her feet, first one then the other. Pinpoints of rain glimmered on her scarf. Our lives had contracted to such a degree that I could not remember the last time a stranger had entered our home; Ai-ming&#x2019;s presence made everything unfamiliar, as if the walls were crowding a few inches nearer to see her. The previous night, we had, at last, tidied Ba&#x2019;s papers and notebooks, putting them into boxes and stacking the boxes under the kitchen table. Now I found the table&#x2019;s surface deceitfully bare. I freed my hand, saying I would put the suitcase in her bedroom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma showed her around the apartment. I retreated to the sofa and pretended to watch the Weather Channel, which predicted rain for the rest of the week, the rest of 1990, the rest of the century, and even the remainder of all time. Their two voices ran one after the other like cable cars, interrupted now and then by silence. The intensity in the apartment crept inside me, and I had the sensation that the floor was made of paper, that there were words written everywhere I couldn&#x2019;t read, and one unthinking gesture could crumple this whole place down.</p><h2>Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes / The Amateur Emigrant</h2><p>In 1878, Robert Louis Stevenson was suffering from poor health, struggling to survive on the income derived from his writings, and tormented by his infatuation with Fanny Osbourne, a married American woman. His response was to embark on a journey through the Cevennes with a donkey, Modestine, and a notebook, which he later transformed into <i>Travels with a Donkey</i>. Just a few months after publication, Stevenson was off again&#x2014;this time crossing the Atlantic and the breadth of America in the hope of being re-united with Fanny, an experience he recorded in <i>The Amateur Emigrant</i>. Both pieces are classics of travel writings, which reveal as much about Stevenson's character as the landscape he travels through.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

On a 12-day trek through the Cevennes, Stevenson&#39;s cross to bear was Modestine, a stubborn, manipulative donkey he could never quite get the better of. After many humorous trials and tribulations, Stevenson found that his disdain for the creature had turned to love, and at the end of the trip he said goodbye with much regret. Written in just a few months when he was in his late twenties, the publication was initially a means to earn a quick buck. Little did Stevenson know that his Modestine would become one of the great characters in travel literature.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

In keeping with this tradition, the Toltec Prophecies of don Miguel Ruiz summarizes Toltec knowledge of the future, details the entrance of humanity into the Sixth Sun, and divulges the insights necessary to make the journey to the next stage of human evolution. Don Miguel Ruiz, author of The Four Agreements, shows how we possess the power to replace fear with a new dream of Heaven on Earth, and that the solution to human survival rests with our Intention. It is in our power, he says, both individually and collectively, to focus our intention to create the vibrant future we desire. The Toltec Prophecies of don Miguel Ruiz comes at a pivotal point in human consciousness when millions of people around the earth are awakening to an expanded awareness that humanity may one day realize and use its deepest gifts to live in peace. Many Westerners find they have lived too long with the foreboding of Armageddon, an unavoidable global cataclysm that they feel helpless to prevent. This threat has produced a pervasive fear that now engulfs our planet, breeding discord, suspicion, and hate. Yet hope remains and springs from unexpected sources -- don Miguel Ruiz shares the wisdom and knowledge that the Toltec ancestors have preserved. Through story and image don Miguel leads readers toward the prophesied new reality and what it will mean for human evolution. &#34;The solution to the survival of humankind rests with our Intention. It is within our power, both individually and collectively, to focus our intention to create the vibrantfuture we desire.&#34;Mary Carroll Nelson is an author, artist, teacher and speaker. She first interviewed don Miguel for her book &#34;Artist of the Spirit&#34; then went on to record his message in &#34;Beyond Fear&#34; where the Toltec prophecies originally appeared.</p><h2>+Anima, Vol. 10</h2><p>The +Anima are beings who possess animal-like powers.

Some holy writings were left out for political or theological reasons, others simply because of the physical restrictions of ancient bookmaking technology. At times, the compilers of the Bible skipped information that they assumed everyone knew. Some passages were even omitted by accident.</p><p>In <i>The Bible's Cutting Room Floor,</i> acclaimed author and translator Dr. Joel M. Hoffman provides the stories and other texts that didn't make it into the Bible even though they offer penetrating insight into the Bible and its teachings.</p><p>The Book of Genesis tells us about Adam and Eve's time in the Garden of Eden, but not their saga after they get kicked out or the lessons they have for us about good and evil. The Bible introduces us to Abraham, but it doesn't include the troubling story of his early life, which explains how he came to reject idolatry to become the father of monotheism. And while there are only 150 Psalms in today's Bible, there used to be many more.</p><p>Dr. Hoffman deftly brings these and other ancient scriptural texts to life, exploring how they offer new answers to some of the most fundamental and universal questions people ask about their lives. An impressive blend of history, linguistics, and religious scholarship, <i>The Bible's Cutting Room Floor</i> reveals what's missing from your Bible, who left it out, and why it is so important.</p></p><p>JOEL M.

Only later would we date the events to 63 years before the birth of Christ, or to the 3,697th year of Creation.</p> <p>It was three months into the siege.</p> <p>In Jerusalem, the hot summer sun had yet to give way to the relative cool of winter&#x2014;Jerusalem&#x2019;s weather fits nicely into three seasons, not four&#x2014;and the sacrificial rites of the first millennium B.C. had yet to mutate into more modern forms of worship. So following a thousand years of tradition, Jewish priests in the great temple oversaw the slaughter of animals for God twice each day, in the morning and again around the ninth hour.</p> <p>The menu for sacrifice was varied. A wealthy man, thankful for a particular stroke of good fortune, brought a bull. Another arrived with a lamb for the same reason. For a third denizen of Jerusalem, a lamb was to atone for a wrongdoing. The poor brought doves when they couldn&#x2019;t afford mammals.</p> <p>The cacophony of so many animals in one place&#x2014;bulls, lambs, goats, and even pigeons&#x2014;combined with the general hubbub of the masses: bellows and bleats, merchants and middlemen, sacrificial incantations and everyday conversations. It was a spectacle, part circus, part sacrament, and part barbecue.</p> <p>The stench of animals both living and dead mixed with the smoky aroma of burnt flesh and blood. The blood from the sacrificial animals was considered particularly important, for in it was the sacred power of life. The priests collected the blood from the slain animals, saving it to be sprinkled by hand on the altar.</p> <p>This particular day, the priests&#x2019; job was made incomparably harder by the onslaught of an invading Roman army as part of the siege. The world&#x2019;s mightiest fighting force had set its sights on the holy city of Jerusalem, leaving human blood running alongside that of the animals.</p> <p>That same year, some 1,400 miles to the northwest, a Roman woman named Atia gave birth to a sickly son whom she called Gaius Octavius. Though his poor health would work against him, his grandmother was Julia, sister to Julius Caesar. This family connection would later help Gaius Octavius earn the title Augustus and become Rome&#x2019;s first emperor.</p> <p>In the same year that Gaius Octavius was born, Caesar himself&#x2014;Gaius Octavius&#x2019;s great uncle&#x2014;was elected pontifex maximus, high priest of the Roman College of Pontiffs. Later he would be called a god. Though in retrospect the signs of Rome&#x2019;s decline are clear, Caesar was apparently unaware of the violent upheavals just around the corner, and equally unaware that he would be assassinated within two decades.</p> <p>Similarly, the Jewish priests&#x2019; power in Jerusalem was dimming, and, like Caesar, they did not know it. The siege in Jerusalem was only part of the problem. The more significant threat to the priests&#x2019; power was internal Jewish turmoil. Sacrifice had been the binding force behind Judaism for nearly a millennium. Now that approach to serving God was being called into question. Maybe, some said, God didn&#x2019;t want sacrifices after all. And maybe the priests weren&#x2019;t as holy as they claimed.</p> <p>A few decades earlier, the Roman Republic&#x2019;s greatest times were waning as that world power struggled through military defeat, political upheaval, and civil war.</p> <p>In 82 B.C., a dictator named Sulla ruthlessly took power. (In one particularly gruesome gesture, he publicly posted the names of his political opponents, signifying that anyone who was able should kill them.) Sulla had a protï¿½gï¿½ named Pompey, who began his own military career at the young age of seventeen. By the time Pompey was in his twenties, his mentor was ruling Rome. This is how Pompey came to command an army, which he took to Damascus&#x2014;part of modern-day Syria&#x2014;in 64 B.C.</p> <p>Pompey had been sent to conquer the region. And with so few armies able to stand up to the fighting force that he had at his disposal, currying favor with the Roman general was seen as a hugely important diplomatic task among the soon-to-be-conquered. Ambassadors from Syria, Egypt, and the Jewish province of Judea (which contained Jerusalem) came to greet Pompey.</p> <p>In fact, two Jewish kings arrived in Damascus. The first was Hyrcanus II, who claimed to be ruler of Jerusalem and king of Judea. The second was his younger brother Aristobulus II, who also claimed to be ruler of Jerusalem and king of Judea.</p> <p>In a not atypical situation for Jerusalem at the time, even as both brothers claimed the holy city as their own, they were utterly despised by the Jews they presumed to rule. Though Hyrcanus and Aristobulus hailed from a priestly family, and though they were descendants of the great Hasmonean Maccabees who revolted against the Syrian Greeks a century earlier to establish an independent Judea, they had both become increasingly Roman in their ways, adopting the lifestyle of pagan monarchs instead of comporting themselves in the familiar Jewish fashion. The Jewish population saw them as representing too sharp a break with tradition. The Jews served priests, who in turn served God. Kings were for other nations.</p> <p>Unable to achieve a popular victory at home, both brothers tried to enlist the help of Pompey. Hyrcanus explained that, as the older brother, he was the rightful king. The younger Aristobulus countered that Hyrcanus was too placid a ruler. Aristobulus explained that he was forced to overthrow his older brother in order to prevent other, nonpriestly forces from wresting control of Jerusalem and pulling it completely out of Jewish hands. It was sibling rivalry playing out on a world stage.</p> <p>In the end, Pompey condemned Aristobulus&#x2019;s behavior as a coup d&#x2019;ï¿½tat but urged both men to exercise restraint. Pompey promised to come to Jerusalem at a later date to settle things. But, bypassing his brother, Aristobulus ignored Pompey and rallied an army. He marched it into Judea, a provocation that infuriated the Roman general with whom he and his brother had just met.</p> <p>In response, Pompey marshaled his legions and set out for Judea himself. Along the way, he took command of a fortress in a place called Corem. Atop a mountain named Alexandrium, due east of Jerusalem and just a dozen miles north of Jericho, Corem was an ideal staging point for an assault on the Jewish capital. From there, Pompey offered Aristobulus one last chance for peace. But Aristobulus, worried that Pompey would give Judea back to his older brother Hyrcanus, refused the peace offer and, instead, prepared for war.</p> <p>So Pompey pitched camp in Jericho and from there marched two dozen miles west into Jerusalem. Seeing the Roman troops, Aristobulus pleaded for peace, surrendering Jerusalem and offering Pompey money. Pompey called off his attack. But Aristobulus reneged. Enraged, Pompey imprisoned Aristobulus and ordered a full assault on Jerusalem.</p> <p>The population of Jerusalem, now left completely without leadership, split into two camps. Some people, fearing Rome&#x2019;s might in the form of Pompey&#x2019;s army, were glad that Aristobulus was out of the picture. This way, they thought, a peaceful settlement with Pompey could be negotiated. Other people feared Rome&#x2019;s rule more than its wrath and hoped to forcibly keep Pompey out of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Jerusalem at the time was fortified on the east, south, and west by walls&#x2014;the north side was more vulnerable&#x2014;and encompassed by a defensive ditch. The Temple itself was also surrounded by walls.</p> <p>Amid the power vacuum and confusion in Jerusalem, Pompey was let into the city from the north, but soon afterward the bridge he had used to enter was destroyed. Even though Pompey was near the Temple, his all-important battering rams and catapults were stuck beyond the ditch, outside Jerusalem. Pompey couldn&#x2019;t yet take the Temple&#x2014;the Jewish seat of religious and political power. But the siege had begun.</p> <p>Pompey&#x2019;s army had to slowly raise a bank, gathering rocks and whatever else they might find to fill in the massive ditch and gain access to Jerusalem from the north. In the meantime, the Jews had not only a tactical problem but a religious one as well. Jewish law at the time prohibited work on the Sabbath. An exception was made for active defense, but not for more general meddling in the enemy&#x2019;s preparations&#x2014;for war or for anything else.</p> <p>The Romans used this to their advantage. While they attacked Jerusalem for six days a week during the siege, on the seventh they ceased all active hostilities, devoting their energies instead only to bridging the ditch. And the Jews, in religious observance, did nothing to interfere. So even though it is usually easier to knock down a hastily built bank than to build one up, the Romans had one day each week during which their progress was essentially unimpeded.</p> <p>Eventually Jerusalem fell. Pompey took the city, brought Aristobulus back to Rome as his captive, and restored the older Hyrcanus to power. Pompey once again made Judea part of the province of Syria (basically the same political power from which the Hasmonean Maccabees had fought for freedom less than a hundred years earlier but now under Roman control). The tax revenue formerly earmarked for the priests was now paid to Rome.</p> <p>Jerusalem had become a pagan city.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the end. The Temple itself&#x2014;the very core of over a thousand years of Jewish service to God&#x2014;would soon be destroyed by Roman forces, never to be rebuilt (to date). The Jews would be exiled. The practice of sacrifice would end.</p> <p>It was also the start of a new beginning. Scripture, already a focus from the first exile of 586 B.C., would take on new importance as the only remnant of pre-exilic Judaism: a sacred souvenir, as it were.</p> <p>Other seeds had been planted in Roman Jerusalem, perhaps most important the precursors of Christianity and of rabbinic Judaism.</p> <p>In short, the thousand-year tradition of Temple-based Judaism was about to end, simply because Hyrcanus and Aristobulus couldn&#x2019;t get past their petty sibling rivalry, prompting Rome to invade.</p> <p>This story of the people and events leading up to the fall of the Temple is well known, even if it seems in some ways unsatisfactory. Of all of the problems presented by this narrative&#x2014;and, certainly, there are many&#x2014;the biggest is this: We don&#x2019;t know how much of it is true.</p> <p>Our fundamental issue is that most of our knowledge about these events comes from a man named Joseph ben Mattityahu, better known simply as Josephus, and his evidence, as we discuss in chapter 4, is suspect for a variety of reasons. He sometimes made things up, for example. So even though we have a compelling and detailed narrative, we also have reason to doubt almost all of it.</p> <p>We do know the broad strokes, though, not just starting in 63 B.C., but even going back to about 1000 B.C., when King David reigned over the fledging nation of the Hebrews in Jerusalem. The short version is that over the next thousand years, Jerusalem would be ruled by Jewish kings; Babylonians, who would exile the Jewish people; Persians; various Greeks based in Greece, Egypt, and Syria; the Jews themselves, in the form of the spectacularly incompetent Maccabees; Romans; Persians again, very briefly; and finally Romans again, who would exile the Jews for the second time.</p> <p>We also know a lot of the particulars.</p> <p>We start around the year 1000 B.C., because we have very little reliable historical evidence for anything earlier, but we have good reason to believe that King David established the Israelite capital right around the start of the first millennium B.C. We also essentially skip over the first four hundred years of his kingdom. They are fascinating in their own right, exhibiting intricate power balances among kings, prophets, and priests, for example, and admitting no small degree of palace intrigue. But ultimately these years have little to do with what Jerusalem looked like at the end of the millennium.</p> <p>So we skip to the year 605 B.C., about four hundred years into the reign of King David and his descendants; the Israelite King Jehoiakim was on the throne, and the great prophet Jeremiah walked the streets of Jerusalem. And we jump to a city on the Euphrates River called Carchemish, by the modern-day Syria-Turkey border, not far from the modern Turkish city of Kargamis.</p> <p>For several hundred years, the major force in the region had been the Assyrian Empire, ruling from their capital of Nineveh, across the Tigris River from modern-day Mosul. Around 705 B.C., the Assyrian king Sargon II had established Carchemish as an Assyrian province.</p> <p>The Babylonians, to the south of the Assyrians, had their own empire, which dated back at least to the days of Hammurabi from the first half of the second millennium B.C. He had established Babylon as the capital of southern Mesopotamia. While the Babylonians had once been the primary power, their power had waned in comparison with the Assyrians.</p> <p>Around 612 B.C., a group of Babylonians joined forces with other local armies in an alliance against the ruling Assyrians. They sacked the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, pushing the Assyrians westward to Harran (in modern-day Turkey), then finally to Carchemish.</p> <p>In 605 the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II (whose name is also spelled Nebuchadrezzar, with an <i>r</i> instead of an <i>n</i>) set out to defeat the Assyrians in Carchemish. Unfortunately for Jerusalem, Egypt had been allied with the Assyrians. Egypt lies to Jerusalem&#x2019;s south, and Carchemish roughly to its east. Or to look at things differently, Jerusalem lies between Egypt and Carchemish. So when Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt set out to help the Assyrians in Carchemish, he had to pass by Jerusalem.</p> <p>When Pharaoh Necho, along with the Assyrians, lost the famous battle of Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar II reestablished the primacy of the Babylonian Empire, in what is commonly called the Neo-Babylonian Empire, to distinguish it from the original Babylonian Empire of the second millennium B.C.</p> <p>Having emerged victorious, Nebuchadnezzar set out to annex all of Egypt to his growing Babylonian Empire. Again unfortunately for Jerusalem, the path from Babylonia back to Egypt, obviously, also runs almost directly through the holy city. This is how David&#x2019;s descendants got caught in the middle of a struggle to rule the world, establishing a pattern that would repeat itself many times.</p> <p>As the Egyptians fought back against the invading Babylonian Empire, they used Jerusalem as a proxy: They urged the Jewish capital to rise up against Babylonia.</p> <p>A few years later, according to both Babylonian and biblical records, Nebuchadnezzar therefore replaced the ruling king in Jerusalem (who at this point was Jehoiakim&#x2019;s son Jeconiah) with a monarch who would, he hoped, be more friendly to Babylonia. His name was Zedukia. And he was Jehoiakim&#x2019;s younger brother. But, perhaps influenced by Pharaoh Psametichus II, Zedukia sided with Egypt, or, at least, refused to side with Babylonia.</p> <p>So around 587 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar, no longer content to play the role of puppet master in Jerusalem, conquered the city, put an end to Zedukia&#x2019;s rule and with it the Davidic monarchy, exiled the Jews, and destroyed the Temple that had served as the symbol and center of Jewish life for nearly half a millennium. This is commonly known as the first exile.</p> <p>One primary destination for the exiled Jew...</p></p><h2>Life of Fred : Elementary Physics</h2><p>Formerly titled "Life of Fred: Elementary Physics".

In <i>Moral Disorder,</i> she has created a series of interconnected stories that trace the course of a life and also the lives intertwined with it&#x2014;those of parents, of siblings, of children, of friends, of enemies, of teachers, and even of animals. As in a photograph album, time is measured in sharp, clearly observed moments. The &#x2019;30s, the &#x2019;40s, the &#x2019;50s, the &#x2019;60s, the &#x2019;70s, the &#x2019;80s, the &#x2019;90s, and the present &#x2014;all are here. The settings vary: large cities, suburbs, farms, northern forests.<br><br>&#x201c;The Bad News&#x201d; is set in the present, as a couple no longer young situate themselves in a larger world no longer safe. The narrative then switches time as the central character moves through childhood and adolescence in &#x201c;The Art of Cooking and Serving,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Headless Horseman,&#x201d; and &#x201c;My Last Duchess.&#x201d; We follow her into young adulthood in &#x201c;The Other Place&#x201d; and then through a complex relationship, traced in four of the stories: &#x201c;Monopoly,&#x201d; &#x201c;Moral Disorder,&#x201d; &#x201c;White Horse,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Entities.&#x201d; The last two stories, "The Labrador Fiasco" and "The Boys at the Lab," deal with the heartbreaking old age of parents but circle back again to childhood, to complete the cycle.<br><br>By turns funny, lyrical, incisive, tragic, earthy, shocking, and deeply personal, <i>Moral Disorder </i>displays Atwood&#x2019;s celebrated storytelling gifts and unmistakable style to their best advantage.

Before, I&#x2019;d only ever been ghosts and fat ladies, both of which were easy: all you needed was a sheet and a lot of talcum powder, or a dress and a hat and some padding. But this year would be the last one I&#x2019;d ever be able to disguise myself, or so I believed. I was getting too old for it &#x2014; I was almost finished with being thirteen &#x2014; and so I felt the urge to make a special effort. Halloween was my best holiday. Why did I like it so much? Perhaps because I could take time off from being myself, or from the impersonation of myself I was finding it increasingly expedient, but also increasingly burdensome, to perform in public. I got the Headless Horseman idea from a story we&#x2019;d read in school. In the story, the Headless Horseman was a grisly legend and also a joke, and that was the effect I was aiming for. I thought everyone would be familiar with this figure: if I&#x2019;d studied a thing in school I assumed it was general knowledge. I hadn&#x2019;t yet discovered that I lived in a sort of transparent balloon, drifting over the world without making much contact with it, and that the people I knew appeared to me at a different angle from the one at which they appeared to themselves; and that the reverse was also true. I was smaller to others, up there in my balloon, than I was to myself. I was also blurrier. I had an image of how the Headless Horseman was supposed to look. He was said to ride around at night with nothing on top of his shoulders but a neck, his head held in one arm, the eyes fixing the horrified viewer in a ghastly glare. I made the head out of papier mï¿½chï¿½, using strips of newspaper soaked in a flour-and-water paste I cooked myself, as per the instructions in <i>The Rainy Day Book of Hobbies</i>. Earlier in my life &#x2014; long ago, at least two years ago &#x2014; I&#x2019;d had a wistful desire to make all the things suggested in this book: animals twisted out of pipe cleaners, balsa-wood boats that would whiz around when you dropped cooking oil into a hole in the middle, and a tractor thing put together out of an empty thread spool, two matchsticks, and a rubber band; but somehow I could never find the right materials in our house. Cooking up paste glue was simple, however: all you needed was flour and water. Then you simmered and stirred until the paste was translucent. The lumps didn&#x2019;t matter, you could squeeze them out later. The glue got quite hard when it was dry, and I realized the next morning that I should have filled the pot with water after using it. My mother always said, &#x201c;A good cook does her own dishes.&#x201d; But then, I reflected, glue was not real cooking. The head came out too square. I squashed it at the top to make it more like a head, then left it down by the furnace to dry. The drying took longer than I&#x2019;d planned, and during the process the nose shrank and the head began to smell funny. I could see that I should have spent more time on the chin, but it was too late to add on to it. When the head was dry enough, at least on the outside, I painted it what I hoped was a flesh colour &#x2014; a wishy-washy bathrobe pink &#x2014; and then I painted two very white eyeballs with black pupils. The eyes came out a little crossed, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped: I didn&#x2019;t want to make the eyeballs grey by fooling around with the black pupils on the damp white paint. I added dark circles under the eyes, and black eyebrows, and black enamel hair that appeared to have been slicked down with brilliantine. I painted a red mouth, with a trickle of shiny enamel blood coming down from one corner. I&#x2019;d taken care to put a neck stub on the bottom of the head, and I painted this red &#x2014; for where the head had been severed &#x2014; with a white circle in the middle of the bottom part, for the neck bone. The body of the Horseman took some thought. I made a cape out of a piece of black fabric left over from a now-obsolete puppet stage of mine, gathering it at the neck end &#x2014; designed to sit on top of my head &#x2014; and sewing buttons down the front, and cutting two inconspicuous holes at eye level so I&#x2019;d be able to see out. I borrowed my mother&#x2019;s jodhpurs and riding boots, left over from before she was married &#x2014; she hadn&#x2019;t ridden a horse since her wedding day, she was in the habit of saying, proudly or regretfully. Probably it was both. But I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to my mother&#x2019;s tone of voice, then: I had to tune it out in order to charge full speed ahead with what I myself was doing. The riding boots were too big, but I made up for that with hockey socks. I safety-pinned the jodhpurs around the waist to keep them from falling down. I got hold of some black winter gloves, and improvised a horse whip out of a stick and a piece of leather I&#x2019;d scrounged from the box of archery materials. Archery had once been popular with my father, and then with my brother; but my father had given it up, and the box had been abandoned in the trunk room in the cellar, now that my brother had to study so much. I tried on the entire outfit in front of my mirror, with the head held in the crook of my arm. I could scarcely see myself through the eyeholes, but the dark shape looming in the glass, with two sinister eyeballs staring out balefully from somewhere near the elbow, looked pretty good to me. On the night itself I groped my way out the door and joined my best friend of the moment, whose name was Annie. Annie had done herself up as Raggedy Ann, complete with a wig of red wool braids. We&#x2019;d taken flashlights, but Annie had to hold my arm to guide me through the darker patches of the night, which were numerous in the badly lit suburb we were traversing. I should have made the eyeholes bigger. We went from door to door, shouting, &#x201c;Shell out! Shell out!&#x201d; and collecting popcorn balls and candy apples and licorice twists, and the Halloween toffees wrapped in orange and black waxed paper with designs of pumpkins and bats on them of which I was especially fond. I loved the sensation of prowling abroad in the darkness &#x2014; of being unseen, unknown, potentially terrifying, though all the time retaining, underneath, my own harmless, mundane, and dutiful self. There was a full moon, I think; there ought to have been one.The air was crisp; there were fallen leaves; jack-o-lanterns burned on the porches, giving off the exciting odour of singed pumpkin. Everything was as I&#x2019;d imagined it beforehand, though already I felt it slipping away from me. I was too old, that was the problem. Halloween was for little children. I&#x2019;d grown beyond it, I was looking down on it from my balloon. Now that I&#x2019;d arrived at the moment I&#x2019;d planned for, I couldn&#x2019;t remember why I&#x2019;d gone to all that trouble. I was disappointed, too, at the response of the adults who answered the doors. Everyone knew who my friend Annie was portraying &#x2014; &#x201c;Raggedy Annie!&#x201d; they cried with delight, they even got the pun &#x2014; but to me they said, &#x201c;And who are you supposed to be?&#x201d; My cape had a muffling effect, so I often had to repeat the answer twice. &#x201c;The Headless Horseman.&#x201d; &#x201c;The headless what?&#x201d; Then, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that you&#x2019;re holding?&#x201d; they would go on to say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the head. Of the Headless Horseman.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh yes, I see.&#x201d; The head would then be admired, though in the overdone way adults had of admiring a thing when they secretly thought it was inept and laughable. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me that if I&#x2019;d wanted my costume to be understood immediately I should have chosen something more obvious. However, there was one member of the audience who&#x2019;d been suitably impressed. It was my little sister, who hadn&#x2019;t yet gone to bed when I&#x2019;d made my way through the living room en route to the door. She&#x2019;d taken one look at the shambling black torso and the big boots and the shiny-haired, frowning, bodiless head, and had begun to scream. She&#x2019;d screamed and screamed, and hadn&#x2019;t been reassured when I&#x2019;d lifted up the cape to show that it was really only me underneath. If anything, that had made it worse. Do you remember the head?&#x201d; I ask my sister. We&#x2019;re in her rackety car, driving over to see our mother, who is now very old, and bedridden, and blind. My sister doesn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;What head?&#x201d; She knows what head. &#x201c;It looked like a pimp,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;With that greaser hair.&#x201d; Then she says, &#x201c;Smart move, Fred.&#x201d; She talks out loud to other, inferior drivers when she&#x2019;s driving, a thing she does adroitly. All of the other drivers are named Fred, even the women. &#x201c;How do you know what a pimp looks like?&#x201d; &#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d; &#x201c;A dead pimp, then,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Not completely dead. The eyes followed you around the room like those 3-D Jesuses.&#x201d; &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t have. They were sort of crossed.&#x201d; &#x201c;They did, though. I was afraid of it.&#x201d; &#x201c;You played with it, later,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;When you were older. You used to make it talk.&#x201d; &#x201c;I was afraid of it anyway,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Fred, take the whole road.&#x201d; &#x201c;Maybe I warped you in childhood,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Something did,&#x201d; she says, and laughs. For a while after that Halloween, the head lived in the trunk room, which contained not only two steamer trunks filled with things of my mother&#x2019;s from her previous life &#x2014; tea cloths she&#x2019;d embroidered for her trousseau, long kid gloves she&#x2019;d saved &#x2014; but also a number of empty suitcases, and the metal box of fly-tying equipment, and the archery materials, and an assortment of miscellaneous items I used to rummage through and pilfer. The head was on an upper shelf, the one with the battered skates and the leather boots &#x2014; my father&#x2019;s, also my mother&#x2019;s.

Louis Bouyer shows the value of the Protestant ideas of the sovereignty of God, justification by faith, and even the centrality of Scripture. He also looks squarely at how Protestantism has suffered from its denial of the sacraments, Church authority, and more. He challenges Catholics and Protestants alike to know their beliefs more deeply &#x2014; an essential foundation to any dialogue.</p><p><p><strong>Louis Bouyer </strong>(1913-2004) was born to a Parisian Protestant family and was ordained as a Lutheran pastor at age 23. He converted to Catholicism in 1939 and was ordained a priest for the Oratory in 1944. He became a prolific theological writer and teacher worldwide. His works have had an enduring impact on Catholic theology. His other books include <em>The Church of God</em> and <em>The Word, Church and Sacraments</em> </p></p><h2>The Complete Pebble Mosaic Handbook</h2><p><p> <i>Extensive guidebook to a popular and rapidly growing craft.</i> </p><p> Many of us have walked the squares of Venice, Rome and Madrid and admired the geometric pavements of pebble mosaics. Made from found stones, and as beautiful as they are durable, pebble mosaics are a welcome addition to gardens, patios, and public spaces. </p><p> <b>The Complete Pebble Mosaic Handbook</b> is the most complete sourcebook for enthusiasts and landscape designers -- an accessible and illustrated guide that covers materials, design, tools and techniques. </p><p> The book lists the best sources to find or buy pebbles; how to choose and test pebbles for strength and quality; and which materials to avoid. There are practical instructions for ensuring the mosaic can withstand frost, foot and vehicle traffic, pollutants, and water. </p><p> The book explains in detail the principles of creating walkways and patios, precast slabs, fountains, pools, and cascades. Illustrated sample projects are followed step-by-step. Designing is also fully explained whether using simple sketches or professional graphic design software. </p><p> A showcase of pebble mosaic from around the world by leading artists demonstrates the craft's vast creative potential. In addition, a section of design ideas features many popular subjects and patterns including animals, heavenly bodies, spirals, borders, floral, fish, flowers, and many more. </p></p><p><p> <b>Maggy Howarth</b> is one of the world's leading authorities on pebble mosaics and author of the bestseller <i>The Art of Pebble Mosaics</i>. </p><p> <b>Foreword</b> </p><p> Is it just coincidence that so many different people enjoy collecting and handling beautiful pebbles? There must be a basic appeal in the pebble as a found object, formed by the great forces of nature, recalling memories of happy childhood days spent on sunny beaches. We are naturally drawn to the smoothness of rounded stone; it's a small and perfect emblem of the earth we walk on. When we pick up a pebble and marvel at its beauty, we are holding a chunk of our planet; and when we pick up handfuls, and arrange them together in patterns, we are reflecting the universe. Children love to do it; so do adults if they give themselves the time to play. Some take the one step further that makes their collection of stones into something more permanent: designing, making and then leaving, for posterity, a pebble mosaic. </p><p> It is now nine years since the publication of <i>The Art of Pebble Mosaics</i>, and a lot has happened in that time. A busy working life, involving many pebble commissions, has led me to some useful discoveries and refinements of the basic techniques. In this book I can share with you some of those new ideas and experiences which I hope will in turn lead to more experimentation and development. </p><p> In addition to research in the workshop, opportunities have also arisen during travel abroad to see for myself some of the marvelous mosaics in far-flung places which have been very little known outside their own countries. Each holiday has become a research trip, trying to take in some of the different pebblework around the world. The photographs and observations are presented here for your delectation. There is so much more out there to discover, and I expect that there will be many more of these adventures -- explorations with eyes down! </p><p> A third source of information has come from readers of the first book. They were invited to contact me with news of any pebble projects of their own. The call didn't fall on stony ground and there has been a steady stream of information about public and private projects, and lots of pictures. Getting those letters and e-mails was like opening a box of delights, each one new and different. Every pair of hands transforms the pebbles differently. The many artists who have contributed to this book and generously shared information show a breadth of vision and invention that is a source of constant joy and admiration. </p><p> What you will see here is the <i>best</i> of pebble mosaic. The criteria for my selection are very simple. Firstly, of course, the work must be principally pebblework (not, say, tesserae). Secondly, it must be good work, and not just anything that happens to be made of pebbles. Sometimes it might be extremely simple, or rough and imperfect, or experimental; it might be quite mundane and everyday, or it might be complex, highly skillful and solidly professional. But, whatever their status, they all have a certain quality in common. They must be either interesting (in whatever way), or original and inventive. I have put in as many as space will permit. Whether or not this can be really thought of as "complete" is a debate for the future. </p><p> In the gazetteer of design ideas at the end of the book you'll find a large collection of pictures and drawings, all of which have been made into pebble mosaics (by me or others) or designed specifically for the medium. A thorough knowledge of pebble mosaic has informed their selection and the drawing of them. It would be wrong of anyone to "copy" them (each design is the copyright of the individual artist); but it is perfectly OK to use them as the inspiration and starting point for new versions. Since time began, artists have fed their imagination from the works of other artists, sparking off new connections and visions. I hope that, in turn, these pages will feed your imagination. That wonderful elusive trigger-point, inspiration, is the vital element that leads, through draftsmanship and selection, to good design. This is what lifts the medium of pebble mosaic from function and craft to a thing of beauty and art. </p><p> Maggy Howarth </p></p><h2>On Becoming Baby Wise, Book 2: Parenting Your Pre-Toddler Five to Fifteen Months</h2><p>Building upon the success so many parents experience with Babywise (establishing regular sleeping patterns in children before the age of eight weeks), Babywise II helps moms and dads add a new dimension to their babies&#39; day: the establishment of right learning patterns. Learning patterns ultimately affect the way a child manages instructions, directions, correction, limitations, freedoms, and new and growing relationships. That&#39;s why it is critical that the first patterns be the right patterns. It is crucial that babies develop the skills they need for the next important stage of development: 14 to 40 months-and now parents can proactively help their children with the valuable, practical wisdom in Babywise II.</p><p>Demand the behavior and correct thinking will eventually follow. Gary Ezzo, a graduate of Talbot Seminary and School of Theology, teams up with pediatrician Dr. Robert Bucknam to explore the role of moral development in a child in this compact sequel to their controversial primer on newborn behavior, <i>On Becoming Baby Wise</i>. Four glowing, compelling commentaries highlight the very first pages of the book, which attempts to guide parents through a critical time in their child's growth and learning (ages 5 through 15 months). The authors make many rational arguments about a parent's duty to expect and encourage consistent, acceptable behaviors when the child is very young; over time, such training will lead to the development of moral concepts. While the outcome is desirable and the method--when used consistently--does work, this particular book lacks the many supportive examples and research references found in the first <i>Baby Wise</i>. The authors encourage readers to familiarize themselves with the original, and openly state that their methods are more effective for graduates of Baby Wise parenting--not demand-fed babies. So, this particular child-rearing book is not meant for all. Chapters feature topics including moral foundations, mealtime and wake-time activities, highchair manners, discipline, and teaching basic sign language. Most of the information is more philosophical than practical. Don't expect to learn "how," so much as "why." <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p><h2>The Projection of the Astral Body (COLLECTOR&#39;S LIBRARY OF THE UNKNOWN)</h2><p>Dr. Carrington, one of the world&#39;s foremost psychic researchers, brings his vast knowledge of scientific investigation to bear in editing the remarkable account of Sylvan Muldoon&#39;s out of body experiences.

With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling <em>Infidel and Nomad</em> argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.</p><p>Today, Hirsi Ali argues, the world's 1.6 billion Muslims can be divided into a minority of extremists, a majority of observant but peaceable Muslims, and a few dissidents who risk their lives by questioning their own religion. But there is only one Islam, and as Hirsi Ali shows, there is no denying that some of its key teachings&#x2014;not least the duty to wage holy war&#x2014;inspire violence not just in the Muslim world but in the West as well.</p><p>For centuries it has seemed that Islam is immune to historical change. But Hirsi Ali is surprisingly optimistic. She has come to believe that a Muslim "Reformation"&#x2014;a revision of Islamic doctrine aimed at reconciling the religion with modernity&#x2014;is at hand, and may even already have begun.</p><p>Partly in response to the barbaric atrocities of Islamic State and Boko Haram, Muslims around the world have at last begun to speak out for religious reform. Meanwhile, events in the West, such as the shocking <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> massacre, have forced Western liberals to recognize that political Islam poses a mortal threat to free speech. Yet neither Muslim reformers nor Western liberals have so far been able to articulate a coherent program for a Muslim Reformation.</p><p>This is where <em>Heretic</em> comes in. Boldly challenging centuries of theological orthodoxy, Ayaan Hirsi Ali proposes five key amendments to Islamic doctrine that Muslims must make if they are to bring their religion out of the seventh century and into the twenty-first. She also calls upon the Western world to end its appeasement of radical Islamists&#x2014;and to drop the bogus argument that those who stand up to them are guilty of "Islamophobia." It is the Muslim reformers who need our backing, she argues, not the opponents of free speech.</p><p>Interweaving her own experiences, historical analogies, and powerful examples from contemporary Muslim societies and cultures, <em>Heretic</em> is not so much a call to arms as a passionate plea for peaceful change and a new era of global tolerance.

Yet, it rises again in the morning, rejuvenated. How is that possible? How could the sun for the Ancient Egyptians the Sungod become young and revitalized during the night, during his night journey? What happens during this time? The Amduat is a description of the journey of the Sungod through the nightworld, that is also the world of the deceased. The knowledge contained in the Amduat is meant for the dead Pharaoh. But the text also recommends this knowledge for living beings.

The resulting world of cold communication and its indifferent alterity, seduction, metamorphoses, metastases, and transparency requires a new form of response. Writing in the shadow of Marshall McLuhan, Baudrillard insists that the content of communication is completely without meaning: the only thing that is communicated is communication itself. He sees the masses writhing in an orgiastic ecstasy of communications.

Few remember that exactly one hundred years before, the American people had been asked to make a similar choice. They were asked to decide whether the United States should be a republic or an empire.<br> <br>Incumbent Republican president William McKinley&#x2019;s vision of the American future lay in &#x201c;Free Trade&#x201d; and overseas empire. By contrast, Democrat William Jennings Bryan was an outspoken anti-imperialist.<br> <br>Few noticed a third choice&#x2014;Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. The socialist movement represented the new working class. To socialists, empire meant one thing and one thing only&#x2014;exploitation.<br> <br>McKinley ran touting a soaring economy and a victory over Spain in the war of 1898. McKinley believed that America must expand to survive.<br> <br>Bryan, a Nebraska populist known as &#x201c;the Great Commoner,&#x201d; was an enemy of industrial tycoons and bankers. He was convinced that McKinley&#x2019;s vision would bring disaster. He quoted Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s comment that &#x201c;If there be one principle more deeply rooted than any other in the mind of every American, it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest.&#x201d;<br> <br>Having now annexed several foreign colonies&#x2014;the Philippines, Guam, Pago Pago, Wake and Midway islands, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico&#x2014;and asserted practical control over Cuba, the United States was about to betray its most precious gift to mankind.<br><br><br> <br>The presidential election of 1900 pitted Republican William McKinley (left), a proponent of American empire and a staunch defender of the eastern establishment, against Democrat William Jennings Bryan (right), a midwestern populist and outspoken anti-imperialist.

He set his sights on acquiring Hawaii, Canada, Alaska, the Virgin Islands, Midway Island, and parts of Santo Domingo, Haiti, and Colombia. A lot of this dream would actually come true.<br> <br>But while Seward dreamed, the European empires acted. Britain led the way in the last thirty years of the nineteenth century, gobbling up 4.75 million square miles of territory, an area significantly larger than the United States. Britain, like the Romans of yore, believed her mission was to bring civilization to mankind. France added 3.5 million square miles. Germany, off to a late start, added one million. Only Spain&#x2019;s empire was in decline.<br> <br>By 1878, European empires and their former colonies controlled 67 percent of the earth&#x2019;s land surface. And by 1914, they controlled an astounding 84 percent. By the 1890s, Europeans had carved up 90 percent of Africa, the lion&#x2019;s share claimed by Belgium, Britain, France, and Germany.<br> <br>The United States was anxious to make up for lost time, and, although empire was a hostile concept to Americans, most of whom had come from immigrant stock, it was now an era dominated by the robber barons&#x2014;in particular, an aristocracy known as the &#x201c;400,&#x201d; with their huge estates, private armies, and legions of employees. Men like J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and William Randolph Hearst held enormous power.<br> <br>The capitalist class, haunted by visions of the revolutionary workers who formed the Paris Commune of 1871, conjured up similar nightmarish visions of radicals upsetting the system in the United States. These radicals or communards were also called communists more than fifty years before the Russian Revolution of 1917.<br> <br>Jay Gould&#x2019;s fifteen-thousand-mile railroad network epitomized the worst of the robber barons. Gould was perhaps the most hated man in America, having once boasted that he could &#x201c;hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the financial panic of &#x201c;Black Friday&#x201d; 1893 hit Wall Street, it triggered the nation&#x2019;s worst depression to date. Mills, factories, furnaces, and mines shut down everywhere in large numbers. Four million workers lost their jobs. Unemployment reached 20 percent.<br> <br>The American Railway Union headed by Eugene Debs responded to layoffs and pay cuts by George Pullman&#x2019;s Palace Car Company and shut down the nation&#x2019;s railroads. Federal troops were sent in on the side of the railroad magnates. Dozens of workers were killed and Debs spent six months in jail.<br> <br>The socialists, trade unionists, and reformers at home protested that capitalism&#x2019;s cyclical depressions resulted from the underconsumption of the working class. In his pioneering photography, Jacob Riis shocked the nation by documenting the misery of New York City&#x2019;s poor. Working-class leaders were arguing for redistributing wealth at home so that working people could afford to buy the goods they produced in America&#x2019;s farms and factories.<br> <br>But the 400&#x2014;the oligarchs&#x2014;responded that this was a form of socialism. They said there could be a bigger pie for all and argued that the U.S. had to compete with foreign empires and dominate the trade of the world so that foreigners would absorb America&#x2019;s growing surplus. The profit was clearly abroad&#x2014;in trade, cheap labor, and cheap resources.<br> <br>The chief prize was China. To tap this vast market, the U.S. would need a modern, steam-powered navy and bases around the world to compete with the British Empire, with its major concession at the port of Hong Kong. Russia, Japan, France, and Germany were all clawing to get in.<br> <br>Businessmen began pressing for a canal across Central America, which would help open the door to Asia.<br> <br>In 1898, in this climate of global competition, the United States annexed Hawaii. Almost one hundred years later, a U.S. congressional resolution apologized &#x201c;to Native Hawaiians&#x201d; for the deprivation of their right &#x201c;to self-determination.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cuba, less than one hundred miles from the shores of Florida, had revolted against the corrupt Spanish rule, and the Spanish reacted by incarcerating much of the population in concentration camps where ninety-five thousand died of disease. As the fighting increased, powerful bankers and businessmen, like Morgan and the Rockefellers, who had millions invested on the island, demanded action from the president&#x2014;to safeguard their interests.<br> <br>President McKinley sent the USS Maine to Havana harbor as a signal to the Spanish that the U.S. was keeping an eye on American interests.<br> <br>On a night in February 1898, with the tropical heat more than one hundred degrees, the Maine suddenly exploded, killing 254 seamen, allegedly sabotaged by the Spanish. The U.S. &#x201c;Yellow Press,&#x201d; led by William Randolph Hearst&#x2019;s New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer&#x2019;s New York World, led a crazed tabloid reaction and created a vigilante climate for war.<br> <br>The Journal cried: &#x201c;Remember the Maine, To Hell With Spain!&#x201d; Millions read it, convinced that Spain, this decaying Catholic power, was capable of any evil deed to preserve her empire. When McKinley declared war, Hearst took credit: &#x201c;How do you like the Journal&#x2019;s war?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Often remembered by Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s symbolically colorful charge up San Juan Hill, the Spanish-American War was over in three months. Secretary of State John Hay called it a &#x201c;splendid little war.&#x201d; Out of almost fifty-five hundred U.S. dead, fewer than four hundred died in battle, the rest succumbing to disease.<br> <br>Sixteen-year-old Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and signed up with the marines. He would become one of America&#x2019;s most famous military heroes, winning two medals of honor in a career that would span America&#x2019;s early descent into global empire.<br> <br>With victory, American businessmen swept in, grabbing assets where they could, essentially making Cuba into a protectorate. United Fruit Company locked up two million acres of land for sugar production. By 1901, Bethlehem Steel and other U.S. businesses owned over 80 percent of Cuban minerals.<br> <br>More than seventy years later, in 1976, an under-reported official investigation by the navy found that the most probable cause of the sinking of the Maine was a boiler that exploded in the tropical heat, causing the ship&#x2019;s ammunition store to explode. As with Vietnam and the two Iraq wars, the U.S., basing its reaction on false intelligence, went to war because it wanted to.<br> <br>In the glow of victory, however, the U.S. found itself with a much bigger problem. It had acquired from the Spanish a gigantic but ramshackle land mass in the Far East&#x2014;the Philippine Islands&#x2014;which were viewed as an ideal refueling stop for China-bound ships. As in the invasion of Baghdad in 2003, the fighting there began successfully. Commodore George Dewey had destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay in May 1898. One anti-imperialist noted, &#x201c;Dewey took Manila with the loss of one man, and all our institutions.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Anti-Imperialist League, founded in Boston in 1898, sought to block U.S. annexation of the Philippines and Puerto Rico. Its ranks included Mark Twain, who famously asked, &#x201c;Shall we go on conferring our Civilization upon the peoples that sit in darkness, or shall we give those poor things a rest?&#x201d;<br> <br>President McKinley chose the former, opting finally for annexation. &#x201c;There was nothing left for us to do,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them and by God&#x2019;s grace do the very best we could by them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died.&#x201d;<br> <br>McKinley ran into one major problem&#x2014;the Filipinos themselves. Under the fiery leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo, the Filipinos had established their own republic in 1899, after being freed from Spain, and, like the Cuban rebels, expected the United States to recognize it. They had overestimated their ally. And now they fought back. After one protest, Americans lay dead on the streets of Manila. America&#x2019;s Yellow Press cried out for vengeance against the barbarians. Torture, including waterboarding, became routine. The insurgents, or &#x201c;our little brown brothers&#x201d; as William Howard Taft, the governor-general of the Philippines, called them, were pumped full of salt water until they swelled up like toads to &#x201c;make them talk.&#x201d; One soldier wrote home, &#x201c;We all wanted to kill &#x2018;niggers.&#x2019; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This shooting human beings beats rabbit hunting all to pieces.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a war of atrocities. When rebels ambushed American troops on the island of Samar, Colonel Jacob Smith ordered his men to kill everyone over the age of ten and turn the island into &#x201c;a howling wilderness.&#x201d;<br> <br>More than four thousand U.S. troops would not return from this guerilla war, which lasted three and a half years. Twenty thousand Filipino guerillas were killed, and as many as two hundred thousand civilians died&#x2014;many from cholera. But because of distorted press reports, mainland Americans comforted themselves with the thought that they had spread civilization to a backward people.<br> <br>American society grew more callous from this war. The doctrine of Anglo-Saxon superiority that justified a nascent empire was also poisoning social relations at home as southern racists, resorting to similar arguments, intensified their campaign to reverse the outcome of the American Civil War and passed new Jim Crow laws enforcing white supremacy and segregation.<br><br><br> <br>Plowing on a Cuban sugar plantation.<br><br><br> <br>The United Fruit Company office building in New Orleans. The Spanish-American War proved quite profitable for American businessmen. Once the war in Cuba ended, United Fruit took 1.9 million acres of Cuban land at 20 cents an acre.<br><br>In China, a similar yearning for independence led to the homegrown Boxer Rebellion of 1898 to 1901. Nationalist-minded Chinese rose up with fury to murder missionaries and throw out all foreign invaders. McKinley sent five thousand American troops to help the Europeans and the Japanese defeat the rebels.<br> <br>Lieutenant Smedley Butler was in the invading force leading his Marines into Beijing where he saw firsthand the way the victorious Europeans treated the Chinese. He was disgusted.<br><br><br> <br>During the Spanish-American War in the Philippines, atrocities were common. U.S. troops employed the torture we now called waterboarding. One reporter wrote &#x201c;our soldiers pumped salt water into men to &#x2018;make them talk.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Thus, as in 2008, the 1900 American election took place with U.S. troops tied down in numerous countries&#x2014;in this case, China, Cuba, and the Philippines. And yet, McKinley, basking in the glow of victory over Spain, beat Bryan by a wider margin than he had in 1896. Socialist Eugene Debs barely registered with under one percent. Americans had clearly endorsed McKinley&#x2019;s vision of trade and empire.<br> <br>At the height of his popularity, in 1901, McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. The assassin had complained about American atrocities in the Philippines. The new president, Theodore Roosevelt, an even more unabashed imperialist, continued McKinley&#x2019;s expansionist policies. And Roosevelt, orchestrating a revolution in Panama, a province of Colombia, signed a treaty with the newly created Panamanian government to lease the Canal Zone, receiving the same rights of intervention the U.S. had forced upon Cuba. The canal was built with great difficulty and finally opened in 1914.<br><br><br> <br>The bodies of dead Filipinos. A Philadelphia reporter wrote that soldiers stood Filipinos on a bridge, shot them, and floated the corpses down the river for all to see.<br><br>In the years to follow, U.S. Marines were repeatedly sent in to protect U.S. business interests in what were now called &#x201c;Banana Republics,&#x201d; considered backward and in need of strong rule by sometimes brutal dictators able to force U.S. business interests down the throats of resistant workers and peasants.<br> <br>Cuba. Honduras. Nicaragua. The Dominican Republic. Haiti. Panama. Guatemala. Mexico. U.S. occupations often lasted for years, sometimes for decades.<br> <br>No one had more firsthand experience intervening in other countries than Smedley Butler, now a major general in the Marine Corps. He was adored by his men, who called him &#x201c;Old Gimlet Eye&#x201d; after a wound sustained in Honduras. And at the end of his long and highly decorated service, he reflected upon his years in uniform. In his book, War Is a Racket, he wrote, &#x201c;I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&#x2019;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it.

And he never will be. But if he isn't a real Avery, then who is he?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community, and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamorous and dangerous Julian Woodbead. At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from and--over his many years--will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country and much more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this, Boyne's most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. <i>The Heart's Invisible Furies</i> is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of August 2017:</strong> Sweeping, magnetic&#x2014;John Boyne&#x2019;s <em>The Heart&#x2019;s Invisible Furies</em> is a novel so grounded in a single character, but it dexterously expands into a fully realized portrait of humanity in all of its messy glory. The author of the bestselling (not to mention heartbreaking) novel, <em>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</em>, has crafted a story that has all the feels &#x2013; it&#x2019;s genuinely funny, romantically tragic, with moments of sickening violence and then just as quickly redemptive resilience. Set in Post-War Ireland, when intolerance cloaked in Catholicism is at its height, we follow the lifespan of the adopted boy Cyril Avery. On the first page, Cyril introduces us to his birth mother and the circumstances in which he was born, and for the rest of the book, the reader is in Boyne&#x2019;s capable hands: waiting, wondering, clamoring to know when he will meet his birth mother and how it will be uncovered that they are related. Told in seven year increments, taking the reader from Dublin to Amsterdam to New York and back, we bear witness to Cyril&#x2019;s life alongside the cultural and societal evolution of Ireland. Weaving in and out of chance encounters with his birth mother, love affairs, decades-long friendships and bitter wounds from the past, Boyne has paced this novel perfectly, providing the reader one of the greatest gifts that fiction can deliver: hope. <em>--Al Woodworth </em>JOHN BOYNE is the author of ten novels for adults, five novels for younger readers and a collection of short stories.

It is an infant management plan offered by Pediatrician Robert Bucknam, M.D. and co-author Gary Ezzo which helps parents successfully and naturally synchronize their baby's feeding time, waketime and nighttime cycles.&nbsp;</p><p>Theologian Gary Ezzo and pediatrician Dr. Robert Bucknam set off cries of alarm in their highly controversial 1995 publication <i>On Becoming Baby Wise</i> by arguing that some crying is natural and healthy for babies. In this updated edition, Ezzo and Bucknam present a comprehensive method to encourage a full night's sleep for the seven- to nine-week-old baby. It's easy to read, easy to follow, supported by research and by testimonials from parents and pediatricians, and includes suggestions for making the process fit into the reader's lifestyle. The authors believe a consistent sleep routine leads to happier, more responsible, and better-adjusted children. But a full night's sleep is just the short-term goal. The long-term goal is training parents to bring order and stability to their families through nurturing the marriage, providing a loving structure for one's children, and allowing flexibility in the process.<p> Twelve chapters cover feeding philosophies, monitoring baby's growth, establishing baby's routine, handling multiple births, and the ever-controversial chapter on when baby cries. The 52-week method involves four phases, beginning with "Stabilization" from birth to week 8. During weeks 9 through 15 ("Extended Night"), babies learn to sleep through the night. Ezzo and Bucknam attempt to teach the difference between a baby's many cries and advise parents on various responses to these cries. Critics dislike Ezzo's strong belief that "child-centered parenting" (feeding baby whenever it cries, sleeping with and "wearing" baby) fosters demanding, insecure toddlers. But for parents who are tired of being tired--or whose previous experience with child-centered parenting supports Ezzo's theory--it may be worth a read. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Gary Ezzo is the Executive Director of Growing Families International. &nbsp;This is an older version that is medically out of date and is currently out of print by the publisher. the authors (Pediatrician Robert Bucknam, M.D. and Gary Ezzo) &amp; publisher recommend pursuing the current edition with isbn 1932740139 which has a pink banner ribbon on the front of the cover.

Hoganson arrived in Champaign, Illinois, after teaching at Harvard, studying at Yale, and living in the D.C. metro area with various stints overseas, she expected to find her new home, well, isolated. Even provincial. After all, she had landed in the American heartland, a place where the nation's identity exists in its pristine form. Or so we have been taught to believe. Struck by the gap between reputation and reality, she determined to get to the bottom of history and myth. The deeper she dug into the making of the modern heartland, the wider her story became as she realized that she'd uncovered an unheralded crossroads of people, commerce, and ideas. But the really interesting thing, Hoganson found, was that over the course of American history, even as the region's connections with the rest of the planet became increasingly dense and intricate, the idea of the rural Midwest as a steadfast heartland became a stronger and more stubbornly immovable myth. In enshrining a symbolic heart, the American people have repressed the kinds of stories that Hoganson tells, of sweeping breadth and depth and soul.<br><br>In <i>The Heartland</i>, Kristin L. Hoganson drills deep into the center of the country, only to find a global story in the resulting core sample. Deftly navigating the disconnect between history and myth, she tracks both the backstory of this region and the evolution of the idea of an unalloyed heart at the center of the land. A provocative and highly original work of historical scholarship, <i>The Heartland </i>speaks volumes about pressing preoccupations, among them identity and community, immigration and trade, and security and global power. And food. To read it is to be inoculated against using the word "heartland" unironically ever again.</p><p><b>Kristin L. Hoganson</b> is the Stanley S.

When I tell them my father has five wives, and I was raised to believe plural marriage is the will of God, these sincere people often ask, <i>But Mrs. Young-how could you believe such a claim? &nbsp; </i><br><br>Faith, I tell them, is a mystery, elusive to many, and never easy to explain. &nbsp; <br><br>Now, with the publication of this autobiography, my enemies will no doubt suspect my motives. Having survived attempts on both my life and character, however, I stand unconcerned by their assaults. I have chosen to commit my memories to the page neither for fame, the trough from which I have drunk and would be happy never to return to, nor fortune, although it is true I am without home and have two small boys to care for. Simply, I wish to expose the tragic state of polygamy's women, who must live in a bondage not seen in this country since the abolishment of slavery a decade ago; and to reveal the lamentable situation of its children, lonely as they are. &nbsp; <br><br>I promise my Dear Reader I shall recount my story truthfully, even when it distresses me to do so. In these pages you will come to know my mother, who by religious duty welcomed four wives into her husband's bed. You will encounter the old woman forced to share her husband with a girl one-fifth her age. And you shall meet the gentleman with so many wives that when one approaches him on the street, he answers, "Madame, do I know you?" &nbsp; <br><br>I can, and will, go on. &nbsp; <br><br>Under what circumstances does such outrage thrive? The Territory of Utah, glorious as it may be, spiked by granite peaks and red jasper rocks, cut by echoing canyons and ravines, spread upon a wide basin of gamma grass and wandering streams, this land of blowing snow and sand, of iron, copper, and the great salten sea-Utah, whose scarlet-golden beauty marks the best of God's handiwork-the Territory of Utah stands defiant as a Theocracy within the borders of our beloved Democracy, imperium in imperio. &nbsp; <br><br>I write not for sensation, but for Truth. I leave judgment to the hearts of my good Readers everywhere. I am but one, yet to this day countless others lead lives even more destitute and enslaved than mine ever was. Perhaps my story is the exception because I escaped, at great risk, polygamy's conjugal chains; and that my husband is the Mormon Church's Prophet and Leader, Brigham Young, and I am his 19th, and final, wife. &nbsp; <br><br>Sincerely Yours, <br>Ann Eliza Young <br>Summer 1874 &nbsp;<br><b>Wife #19: <br>A Desert Mystery </b><br>By Jordan Scott &nbsp; <br><br><b>Prologue</b> <br><i>Her Golden Boy &nbsp; </i><br><br>According to the <i>St. George Register</i>, on a clear night last June, at some time between eleven and half-past, my mom-who isn't anything like this-tiptoed down to the basement of the house I grew up in with a Golden Boy .22 in her hands. At the foot of the stairs she knocked on the door to my dad's den. From inside he called who is it? She answered me, BeckyLyn. He said-or must've said-come in. What happened next? Nearly everyone in southwest Utah can tell you. She nailed an ace shot and blew his heart clean from his chest. The paper says he was in his computer chair, and from the way the blood splattered the drywall they're pretty sure the blast spun him three times around. &nbsp; <br><br>At the time of his death my dad was online playing Texas hold em and chatting with three people, including someone named DesertMissy. He spent the final seconds of his life in this exchange: &nbsp; <br><br>Manofthehouse2004: hang on <br><br>DesertMissy: phone? <br><br>Manofthehouse2004: no my wife <br><br>DesertMissy: which one? <br><br>Manofthehouse2004: #19 &nbsp; <br><br>Sometime later-a few seconds? minutes?-DesertMissy wrote: u there?? &nbsp; <br><br>Later she tried again: u there???? &nbsp; <br><br>Eventually she gave up. They always do. &nbsp; <br><br>When my mom pulled the trigger my dad had a full house, three fives and a pair of ducks. He was all in. The paper says although dead, he ended up winning seven grand. &nbsp; <br><br>I once heard someone on tv say we die as we lived. That sounds about right. After my dad was shot the blood seeped across his gunsandammo.com t-shirt in a heavy stain. He was sixty-seven, his face pre-cancerously red. Everything about him was thick and worn from a life boiled by the sun. When I was a kid I used to dream he was a cowboy. I would imagine him out in the barn saddling his roan with the white socks, readying himself for a ride of justice. But my dad never rode anywhere for justice. He was a religious con man, a higher-up in a church of lies, the kind of schemer who goes around saying God meant for man to have many women and children and they shall be judged on how they obey. I know people don't really talk like that, but he did and so do a lot of the men where I come from, which is-let's just say-way the fuck out in the desert. You might've heard of us. The First Latter-day Saints, but everyone knows us as the Firsts. I should tell you right off we weren't Mormons. We were something else-a cult, a cowboy theocracy, a little slice of Saudi America. We've been called everything. I know all that because I left six years ago. That was the last time I saw my dad. My mom too. I know you know this but just in case: she was wife #19. &nbsp; <br><br>His first wife was more than willing to put the rap on my mom. For someone who wasn't supposed to talk to nonbelievers, Sister Rita had no trouble telling the <i>Register</i> everything. "I was up in the keeping room with the girls' hose," she blabbed to the paper. "That's when I saw her come upstairs. She had one of those faces-it looked funny, all squished up and <i>red</i>, like she'd seen something. I thought about asking but I didn't, I don't know why. I found him about twenty minutes after that when I went down myself. I should've gone down the minute I saw that face of hers, but how was I supposed to know? When I saw him in his chair like that, with his head, you know, just hanging in his chest like that, and all that blood-it was everywhere, I mean all over him, everything so, so <i>wet</i>, and <i>red</i>-well I started calling, just calling out to anyone for help. That's when they came running down, all of them, the women I mean, one after the next, the kids too, they kept coming. The house shook, there were so many running down the stairs. The first to get there was Sister Sherry, I think. When I told her what happened, and then she saw for herself, she started crying, screaming really, and the next one, she started crying too, and then the next after her, and so on. I never heard anything like it. The shrieks spread up the line, like fire, catching and spreading, one after the next and pretty soon it seemed the whole house was on fire with screams, if you know what I mean. You see, we all loved him just the same." &nbsp; <br><br>The next morning the Lincoln County sheriff handcuffed my mom: "You'll have to come with me, Sister." I don't know who called him in, he usually didn't get out to Mesadale. There's a picture of her being guided into the backseat of the cruiser-the rope of her braid flat against her back as she ducks in. The paper says she didn't resist. Tell me about it. She didn't resist when her husband married her fifteen-year-old niece. She didn't resist when the Prophet told her to throw me out. "No point in making a fuss"-she used to say that all the time. For years she was obedient, believing it part of her salvation. Then one day I guess she went <i>pop!</i> That's how these things go, you hear about it all the time. Except because of the suppressor it was probably more like a <i>phump!</i> than a <i>pop! &nbsp;</i> <br><br>Did Sister Rita do her in? Actually, it was the chat session. The <i>Register</i> loved the irony: <i>VICTIM NAMES HIS MURDERER BEFORE SHE PULLS THE TRIGGER</i>. Technically he didn't name her, he numbered her. But really, Rita's statement didn't help either. It gave the sheriff enough. The next day my mom was booked and that picture was up on the <i>Register</i>'s home page, my mom sliding into the cruiser, her hair a heavy chain. &nbsp; <br><br>That's how I found out. I was at the library with my friend Roland. We were tooling around the web, checking out nothing in particular, then all of a sudden there it was, the story about my mom: &nbsp; <br><br><i>WIFE #19 KILLS HUSBAND<br>Sign of Strife in Renegade Sect? &nbsp;</i> <br><br>In the picture she's shackled at the wrists. Her forehead is white and glossy, reflecting a camera's flash in the dawn, and she has a look in her eyes. How to describe it? Should I say her eyes were dark and damp, the eyes of a small snouted animal? Or will you know what I mean if I say she had the scared-shitless look of a woman busted for murder and about to spend the rest of her life in the can? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>In the Galway Silence (Jack Taylor Novels, 15)</h2><p>Ken Bruen has been called &#x201c;hard to resist, with his aching Irish heart, silvery tongue, and bleak noir sensibility&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>). His prose is as characteristically sharp as his outlook in the latest Jack Taylor novel, <i>In the Galway Silence</i>.<p> <br><br> After much tragedy and violence, Jack Taylor has at long last landed at contentment. Of course, he still knocks back too much Jameson and dabbles in uppers, but he has a new woman in his life, a freshly bought apartment, and little sign of trouble on the horizon. Once again, trouble comes to him, this time in the form of a wealthy Frenchman who wants Jack to investigate the double-murder of his twin sons. Jack is meanwhile roped into looking after his girlfriend&#x2019;s nine-year-old son, and is in for a shock with the appearance of a character out of his past. The plot is one big chess game and all of the pieces seem to be moving at the behest of one dangerously mysterious player: a vigilante called &#x201c;Silence,&#x201d; because he&#x2019;s the last thing his victims will ever hear.</p><p> <br><br> This is Ken Bruen at his most darkly humorous, his most lovably bleak, as he shows us the meaning behind a proverb of his own design&#x2015;&#x201c;the Irish can abide almost anything save silence.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Ken Bruen</b> received a doctorate in metaphysics, taught English in South Africa, and then became a crime novelist.

Maj Sjï¿½wall is also a poet.</p><h2>The Awakened Eye</h2><p>Wants to the extraordinary enthusiasm with which his previous book was received, Frederick Franck has written more and in greater depth about the spiritual aesthetic approach he calls seeing and drawing as meditation. In this meditative discipline, the hands learn to mirror what the eye perceives without the intellect interfering. Instead of our habitual looking, we begin to recover the lost art of seeing, for through the act of the drawing we see living things around us, and ourselves, with a new awareness. Each stroke, each dot upon the paper is a precise measure of the quality of that awareness. Hence seen and drawing as meditation does not require any previous art training and can be practiced alone. The author includes in this book a vividly written workshop for those unable to attend one of the live workshop retreats that he is conducted all over the United States. This is also a refresher course for those who have attended and are now on their own. The author&#39;s drawings and paintings are part of the permanent collections of more than a dozen museums in America and abroad. He is an uncommonly versatile man.</p><p></p><h2>Valentine Schlegel - Je Dors, Je Travaille (French Edition)</h2><p>Now in its third edition, this catalogue offers a unique insight into the life and work of the French artist, sculptor, and ceramist Valentine Schlegel. It features a large iconography, archives, and texts by sculptor and Schlegel specialist Hï¿½lï¿½ne Bertin. Originally published in 2017 on the occasion of an exhibition at CAC Brï¿½tigny, it forms a fitting tribute to Schlegel, who can be considered one of the most important ceramists of 1950s. She conceived her works as sculptures inspired by nature, primitive but sophisticated at the same time. An extensive look at her sculpted interiors and architectural elements in plaster, especially the numerous fireplaces she created, is also featured.</p><p></p><h2>Magic Words: The Extraordinary Life of Alan Moore</h2><p>For three decades comics fans and creators have looked to Alan Moore to map out the state of the art of the medium. In works such as Watchmen, V for Vendetta and From Hell he has redefined the possibilities of the genre, attracting literary plaudits and a mainstream audience far removed from his cult origins. His standing in popular culture is so high that some of the biggest names in Hollywood vie to adapt his books for cinema. Yet his career is a perfect illustration of grand imagination smashing headlong into corporate mediocrity. A principled eccentric, rooted in a very English counter-culture, to this very day he lives in the town of his birth &#x2013; Northampton &#x2013; professing greater interest in performance art, magic and erotica than he does a business he regards as exploitative and derivative. Moreover, his journey from the punky art labs of the 1970s to the bestseller lists has seen him embroiled in fierce feuds with some of the entertainment industry&#x2019;s biggest companies. Now, in anticipation of his 60th birthday, Moore aficionado Lance Parkin goes in search of this extraordinary gentleman, and reveals a writer quite unlike any other working today.<br></p><p>LANCE PARKIN is a British author, best known for writing fiction and reference books for television series, most notably Doctor Who. He is an Alan Moore completist, having followed the comics maestro's career since the 1970s, and in 2001 he wrote an acclaimed guide to Moore's work, which has since been updated and reissued. In addition to contributing pieces to magazines such as TV Zone, SFX and Doctor Who Magazine, he is also the co-author of Dark Matters, a guide to Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. He lives in the USA.<br>&#x2018;In&nbsp;<i>Magic Words</i>&nbsp;Lance Parkin has crafted a biography that is insightful, scrupulously fair-minded and often very funny, a considerable achievement given its unrelentingly grim, unreasonable and annoying subject.

Artifact-rich burial grounds, like the megalithic tombs at Newgrange, Ireland, inscribed stones, and stone circles like Stonehenge, all yield clues to their mysterious ways.<br><br>National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.<br>Visit&nbsp;www.natgeoed.org/commoncore&nbsp;for more information.</p><p><b>Jen Green</b> received a doctorate from the University of Sussex in 1982.

Her titles include <i>National Geographic Investigates: Ancient Celts </i>and several books from the National Geographic Countries of the World series.Grade 3&#x2013;7&#x2014;With excellent-quality photographs and a well-written text, this is a thorough presentation of the most up-to-date knowledge about this ancient European culture, from its origins in 800 B.C. through A.D. 500, and cites the echoes of Celtic traditions that live on today. Aerial photos, time lines, informative sidebars, and National Geographic's famous maps augment text that asks and answers interesting questions ("Why did the Celts make human sacrifices?" "What happened when the Romans came?"). Rigorous in its distinction between theory, supposition, and proven fact, the book has photos of artifacts, sites, and physical remains&#x2014;including close-ups of Celtic "bog people" showing details such as manicured fingernails and hairdos. Scale is scrupulously noted for all objects and structures in both English and metric units. Numerous explanations of techniques and processes&#x2014;both of the Celts and those employed by archaeologists to study them&#x2014;inject an element of how-to, a canny addition that will hook readers fascinated by how things work and how we figure things out. Previous books on the subject for this age group have concentrated on the British Isles, or have focused on Celtic myths or daily life. <i>Ancient Celts</i> is a balanced, scientific account that doesn't stint on the mummified remains. Sure to appeal to a broad range of learners.&#x2014;<i>Paula Willey, Baltimore County Public Library, Towson, MD</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Did the home and family life matter to most people? In this wide-ranging work, Steven Ozment has gathered the answers of contemporaries to these questions. His subject is the patriarchal family in Germany and Switzerland, primarily among Protestants. But unlike modern scholars from Philippe Ariï¿½s to Lawrence Stone, Ozment finds the fathers of early modern Europe sympathetic and even admirable. They were not domineering or loveless men, nor were their homes the training ground for passive citizenry in an age of political absolutism. From prenatal care to graveside grief, they expressed deep love for their wives and children. Rather than a place where women and children were bullied by male chauvinists, the Protestant home was the center of a domestic reform movement against Renaissance antifeminism and was an attempt to resolve the crises of family life. Demanding proper marriages for all women, Martin Luther and his followers suppressed convents and cloisters as the chief institutions of womankind&#x2019;s sexual repression, cultural deprivation, and male clerical domination. Consent, companionship, and mutual respect became the watchwords of marriage. And because they did, genuine divorce and remarriage became possible among Christians for the first time.</p><p>This graceful book restores humanity to the Reformation family and to family history.</p></p><p>Steven Ozment is McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History at Harvard University.

In the scorching desert, Pitt finds a gold mine manned by slaves and uncovers the truth behind two enduring mysteries -- the fate of a Civil War ironclad and its secret connection with Lincoln&#39;s assassination, and the last flight of a long-lost female pilot....Now, amidst the blazing, shifting sands of the Sahara, DIRK PITT will make a desperate stand -- in a battle the world cannot afford to lose!</p><p><b>Clive Cussler</b> is acclaimed worldwide as the Grandmaster of Adventure. He got his start in advertising, first as an award-winning copy writer, and then as creative director for two of the nation's largest agencies. His initial foray into fiction was in 1973, when he wrote his first Dirk Pittï¿½ novel.<p>Since then he has continued to write Dirk Pittï¿½ adventures while living a life that nearly parallels that of his action hero. Like Pitt, Cussler enjoys discovering and collecting things of historical significance. With NUMA (National Underwater &amp; Marine Agency, a non profit group begun by Cussler) he has had an amazing record of finding over 60 shipwrecks, one of which was the long-lost Confederate submarine Hunley. Cussler also has a renowned and extensive classic car collection, which features over 80 examples of custom coachwork.</p><p>Along with being Chairman of NUMA, he is also a fellow of the Explorers Club (which honored him with the Lowell Thomas Award for outstanding underwater exploration), the Royal Geographical Society and the American Society of Oceanographers. Married to Barbara Knight for 40 years, with three children and two grandchildren, he divides his time between the mountains of Colorado and the deserts of Arizona.</p>Ï»ï¿½<p> <i>April 2, 1865<br> Richmond, Virginia</i> <br> <br> </p><p> SHE SEEMED TO float above the ghostly evening mist like a menacing beast rising from the primeval ooze. Her low silhouette stood black and ominous against the backdrop of the trees along the shoreline. Shadowy, phantom-like images of men moved across her decks under the eerie yellow glow of lanterns as moisture trickled down her gray, sloping sides and dripped into the sluggish current of the James River. </p><p> The <i>Texas</i> tugged at her dockside mooring line as impatiently as a hound about to be unleashed for the hunt. Thick iron shutters covered her gun-ports and the 6-inch armor on her casemate showed no markings. Only a white and red battle ensign atop the mast behind her smokestack, hanging limp in the damp atmosphere, signified her as a warship of the Confederate States Navy. </p><p> To landsmen she looked squat and ugly, but to sailors there was a character and grace about her that was unmistakable. She was tough, and she was deadly, the last of her peculiar design that set sail on a cruise to extinction after a brief but enduring burst of glory. </p><p> Commander Mason Tombs stood on the forward deck, pulled a blue bandana from a pocket, and dabbed at the dampness that seeped inside the collar of his uniform. The loading was going slow, too slow. The <i>Texas</i> would need every minute of available darkness for her escape to the open sea. He watched anxiously as his crew swore and strained while they manhandled wooden crates across a gangplank and down an open hatch on the deck. The crates seemed unusually heavy for containing the written records of the four-year-old government. They came from mule-drawn wagons deployed near the dock that were strongly guarded by the battle-weary survivors of a Georgia infantry company. </p><p> Tombs turned an uneasy eye toward Richmond, only 2 miles to the north. Grant had broken Lee's stubborn defense of Petersburg, and now the battered army of the South was retreating toward Appomattox and abandoning the Confederate capital to the advancing Union forces. The evacuation was underway and the city was filled with confusion as riots and pillaging swept the streets. Explosions shook the ground and flames burst into the night as warehouses and arsenals filled with supplies of war were put to the torch. </p><p> Tombs was ambitious and energetic, one of the finest naval officers in the Confederacy. He was a short, handsome-faced man with brown hair and eyebrows, a thick red beard, and a flinty look in his olive black eyes. </p><p> Commander of small gunboats at the battles of New Orleans and Memphis, gunnery officer on board the fighting ironclad <i>Arkansas,</i> and first officer of the infamous sea raider <i>Florida,</i> Tombs had proven a dangerous man for the Union cause. He had assumed command of the <i>Texas</i> only a week after she was completed at the Rocketts naval yard in Richmond, having demanded and supervised a number of modifications in preparation for an almost impossible voyage downriver past a thousand Union guns. </p><p> He turned his attention back to the cargo loading as the last wagon pulled away from the dock and disappeared into the night. He slipped his watch from a pocket, opened the lid, and held up the face toward a lantern that hung on a dock piling. </p><p> It read eight-twenty. Little more than eight hours left before daylight. Not enough time to run the last 20 miles of the gauntlet under the cloak of darkness. </p><p> An open carriage pulled by a team of dappled horses rolled up and stopped beside the dock. The driver sat stiffly without turning as the two passengers watched the final few crates being lowered through the hatch. The heavier man in civilian clothes slouched tiredly while the other, who was wearing an officer's naval uniform, spied Tombs and waved. </p><p> Tombs stepped across the plank onto the dock, approached the carriage, and saluted smartly. "An honor, Admiral, Mr. Secretary. I didn't think either of you would have time for a farewell." </p><p> Admiral Raphael Semmes, famed for his exploits as captain of the Confederate sea wolf, <i>Alabama, </i>and now commander of the James River squadron of ironclad gunboats, nodded and smiled through a heavily waxed moustache and a small goatee protruding beneath his lower lip. "A regiment of Yankees couldn't have kept me from seeing you off." </p><p> Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Confederate States Navy, stretched out a hand. "Too much is riding on you for us not to take the time to wish you luck." </p><p> "I've a stout ship and a brave crew," said Tombs with confidence. "We'll break through." </p><p> Semmes' smile faded and his eyes filled with foreboding. "If you find it impossible, you must burn and scuttle the ship in the deepest part of the river so that our archives can never be salvaged by the Union." </p><p> "The charges are in place and primed," Tombs assured Semmes. "The bottom hull will be blown away, dropping the weighted crates in the river mud while the ship continues a safe distance away under full steam before sinking." </p><p> Mallory nodded. "A sound plan." </p><p> The two men in the carriage exchanged strange knowing looks. An awkward moment passed. Then Semmes said, "I'm sorry to lay another burden on your shoulders at the last moment, but you will also be responsible for a passenger." </p><p> "Passenger?" Tombs repeated grimly. "No one who values his life I trust." </p><p> "He has no choice in the matter," Mallory muttered. </p><p> "Where is he?" Tombs demanded, gazing around the dock. "We're almost ready to cast off." </p><p> "He will arrive shortly," replied Semmes. </p><p> "May I ask who <i>he</i> is?" </p><p> "You will recognize him easily enough," said Mallory. "And pray the enemy also identifies him should you need to put him on display." </p><p> "I don't understand." </p><p> Mallory smiled for the first time. "You will, my boy, you will." </p><p> "A piece of information you may find useful," said Semmes, changing the subject. "My spies report that our former ironclad ram, the <i>Atlanta,</i> captured last year by Yankee monitors, has been pressed into service by the Union navy and is patrolling the river above Newport News." </p><p> Tombs brightened. "Yes, I see. Since the <i>Texas</i> has the same general shape and approximate dimensions she could be mistaken for the <i>Atlanta</i> in the dark." </p><p> Semmes nodded and handed him a folded flag. "The stars and stripes. You'll need it for the masquerade." </p><p> Tombs took the Union banner and held it under one arm. "I'll have it run up the mast shortly before we reach the Union artillery emplacements at Trent's Reach." </p><p> "Then good luck to you," said Semmes. "Sorry we can't stay to see you cast off, but the Secretary has a train to catch and I have to return to the fleet and oversee its destruction before the Yankees are upon us." </p><p> The Secretary of the Confederate navy shook Tombs' hand once more. "The blockade runner <i>Fox</i> is standing by off Bermuda to recoal your bunkers for the next leg of your voyage. Good fortune to you, Commander. The salvation of the Confederacy is in your hands." </p><p> Before Tombs could reply, Mallory ordered the carriage driver to move on. Tombs raised his hand in a final salute and stood there, his mind failing to comprehend the Secretary's farewell. Salvation of the Confederacy? The words made no sense. The war was lost. With Sherman moving north from the Carolinas and Grant surging south through Virginia like a tidal wave, Lee would be caught between the Union pincers and forced to surrender in a matter of days. Jefferson Davis would soon be broken from President of the Confederate States to a common fugitive. </p><p> And within a few short hours, the <i>Texas</i> had every expectation of being the last ship of the Confederate navy to die a watery death. </p><p> Where was the salvation should the <i>Texas</i> make good her escape? Tombs failed to fathom a vague answer. His orders were to transport the government's archives to a neutral port of his choosing and remain out of sight until contacted by courier. How could the successful smuggling of bureaucratic records possibly prevent the certain defeat of the South? </p><p> His thoughts were interrupted by his first officer, Lieutenant Ezra Craven. </p><p> "The loading is completed and the cargo stored, sir," announced Craven. "Shall I give the order to cast off?" </p><p> Tombs turned. "Not yet. We have to take on a passenger." </p><p> Craven, a big brusque Scotsman, spoke with a peculiar combination of brogue and southern drawl. "He'd better make it damned quick." </p><p> "Is Chief Engineer O'Hare ready to get underway?" </p><p> "His engines have a full head of steam." </p><p> "And the gun crews?" </p><p> "Manning their stations." </p><p> "We'll stay buttoned up until we meet the Federal fleet. We can't afford to lose a gun and crew from a lucky shot through a port beforehand." </p><p> "The men won't take kindly to turning the other cheek." </p><p> "Tell them they'll live longer -- " </p><p> Both men swung and stared toward the shore at the sound of approaching hooves. A few seconds later a Confederate officer rode out of the darkness and onto the dock. </p><p> "One of you Commander Tombs?" he asked in a tired voice. </p><p> "I'm Tombs," he said, stepping forward. </p><p> The rider swung down from his horse and saluted. He was covered with road dust and looked exhausted. "My compliments, sir. Captain Neville Brown, in charge of the escort for your prisoner." </p><p> "Prisoner," Tombs echoed. "I was told he was a passenger." </p><p> "Treat him as you will," Brown shrugged indifferently. </p><p> "Where is he?" Tombs asked for the second time that night. </p><p> "Immediately behind. I rode out in advance of my party to warn you not to be alarmed." </p><p> "Is the man daft?" muttered Craven. "Alarmed at what?" </p><p> His question was answered as a closed coach rumbled onto the dock surrounded by a detachment of riders dressed in the blue uniform of Union cavalry. </p><p> Tombs was on the verge of shouting for his crew to run out the guns and repel boarders when Captain Brown calmly reassured him. "Rest easy, Commander. They're good southern boys. Dressing up like Yankees was the only way we could p...</p></p><h2>Shaping Success</h2><p>Why reinvent the wheel Shaping Success contains a career&#39;s worth of training experience.

He lives in the mountains of northern California.Grade 4-6-When young Howard visits the historic Knight Foundry in Sutter Creek, CA, he finds more than Russ, a worker who demonstrates iron casting. From the shadows come the ghosts of skilled foundrymen from the prosperous days of the past. Acting as an apprentice to these specters, Howard learns to pack sand in the drag, ram the mold, and prepare for the pour. The next day the furnace, heated by tons of coke, is ready to melt the scrap iron. Soon Howard, Russ, and a crew of workers ladle the hot metal into the molds and produce cast iron wheels, gears, and weights, just as it was done in the past. Weitzman's dramatic, sculptured pencil-and-ink drawings clearly show the foundry, tools, and processes, and the "ghost" workers appear in several archival photographs dating from the turn of the century. Unfortunately, the attempt to make a personal story out of a technical process is less successful here than in the author's naval history, Old Ironsides (Houghton, 1997). The mixture of fact and fiction, past and present is, in this work, a transparent device that tends to confuse and detract from the explanation of the step-by-step process of iron casting, which is the real subject of the book. Still, the fine illustrations, the display of labeled tools on the endpapers, and the book title itself should attract readers interested in machines and manufacturing.<br><i>Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt</h2><p><b>The date is January 11, 1911</b>. A young German paleontologist, accompanied only by a guide, a cook, four camels, and a couple of camel drivers, reaches the lip of the vast Bahariya Depression after a long trek across the bleak plateau of the western desert of Egypt. The scientist, Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach, hopes to find fossil evidence of early mammals. In this, he will be disappointed, for the rocks here will prove to be much older than he thinks. They are nearly a hundred million years old.

He is the co-editor of the Penguin Book of Art Writing. Currently chief art critic for Bloomberg, Gayford lives in Cambridge, England, with his wife and two children.<i>Starred Review.</i> Van Gogh's reputation in the public imagination has been made as much by his descent into madness as by his art. Detailing the final year of his life and the "Studio of the South" in which Gauguin and Van Gogh painted side by side, Gayford brings the art back into focus. Explications of the works illuminate the collaboration&#x2014;similar subjects find very different treatment by two entirely different temperaments. Yet their influence on each other is everywhere&#x2014;a story that Van Gogh recommends to Gauguin finds its way into a painting; Van Gogh uses the jute canvas that is Gauguin's material of choice. While some of this is well-trodden territory, Gayford's narrative is genuinely dramatic as it moves toward Van Gogh's fateful end. Gayford makes exciting new connections between the tone of Van Gogh's correspondence and known scholarship about his probable bipolar disorder. The influences of literature, the news media and so-called "hygienic excursions" (visits to the local brothels) percolate in these letters and under the surfaces of the artists' canvases. So, argues Gayford, were they invading Van Gogh's mind. Though it is impossible to entirely understand what motivated these two great artists during their weeks together in Arles, these pages deliver as close and vivid an image as may be possible. 60 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Nov. 14)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chen's concept is unique, and [his characters'] agony is deeply moving. Quick pacing, complex characters, and a fascinating premise make this an unforgettable debut." &#x2013;Publishers Weekly, starred review<br><br>"Chen's debut novel is a welcome addition to this well-traveled genre, with the theories and mechanics of time travel not getting in the way of the character- and plot-driven story. Highly recommended for readers both new and familiar with the genre, and for fans of Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife or books by Connie Willis." &#x2013;Library Journal, starred review<br><br>"At its core, Chen's book is really about the prides and perils of parenthood, and I'm certain that's what I'll always remember about it....

These touch realities are not given much attention by many people until midlife, when they become harder to avoid. Using a Buddhist text known as the Five Subjects for Frequent Recollection, Larry Rosenberg shows how intimacy with the realities of aging can actually be used as a means to liberation. When we become intimate with these inevitable aspects of life, he writes, we also become intimate with ourselves, with others, with the world&#x2014;indeed with all things.</p><p>Those aches and pains, that sagging and graying--the booby trap of death is hidden in the undergrowth of the future, but how far into the future? One of the Buddha's great realizations was of the reality of aging and death. As Larry Rosenberg points out, it's not the reality that is the problem but what our minds do with it. One of America's leading meditation teachers, Rosenberg has in his repertoire a time-honored meditation practice: death meditation. In a sense, all Buddhist meditation is about facing impermanence, but death meditation is facing the ultimate impermanence. In <i>Living in the Light of Death</i>, Rosenberg brings forth some of his best anecdotes from his stays in foreign lands (and other painful experiences) to illustrate that aging, illness, and death can not only try us but teach us as well. To meditate on them is to initiate that teaching process. What Rosenberg has realized and tried to pass on to others is that although we cannot avoid the painful or frightening phenomena of the body, they do not have to weigh us down and can instead lend a lightheartedness to living. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Larry Rosenberg is founder and resident teacher of the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a guiding teacher at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Activities for the Abacus: A Hands on Approach to Arithmetic</h2><p>activities using abacus, a hands on approach to arithmetic</p><p></p><h2>Metamaus: Viaje al interior de un clï¿½sico moderno, Maus (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Visually and emotionally rich, MetaMaus is as groundbreaking as the masterpiece whose creation it reveals.

Not twenty miles from here as the crow flies. But it used to take all day to drive out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What road is it on?&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked at me like I had two heads. With a laugh, she explained, &#x201c;The town of Proctor was out on Hazel Creek&#x2014;it&#x2019;s now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. But we was all forced to move out when they built Fontana Dam and the government stole our land for the park.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When was that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nineteen hundred and forty-four. I was thirty-five years old when we left our old home place. My grandpappy had homesteaded the land.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Proctor musta been a hole in the wall.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shook her head and looked at me once again as if I was dimwitted. &#x201c;Heckfire, son, because of Calhoun Lumber Company, Proctor had well over a thousand citizens in the 1920s. It was bigger then than Bryson City is now. But our farm was a long way from town&#x2014;about six miles up valley. And walkin&#x2019; those miles seemed to take an eternity back then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Miss Abbie&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made that mistake twice now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Callin&#x2019; me Miss Abbie. It&#x2019;s Mrs. Abbie,&#x201d; she corrected. &#x201c;Was married nearly seventy years to a wonderful man.&#x201d; She showed me her wedding band. &#x201c;One of my most prized possessions. Was my mama&#x2019;s . . . once upon a time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Mrs. Abbie, I bet it was a unique time to live back in the Roaring Twenties.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed. &#x201c;No one accused Proctor of bein&#x2019; a roarin&#x2019; anythin&#x2019;. But Hazel Creek was unique. Some called it the &#x2018;Wild East.&#x2019; Others, like Reid, called it the &#x2018;Land of the Sky.&#x2019; Hazel Creek had wild animals like panthers and bears, Cherokee Indians, desperados, lumbermen, moonshiners, revenuers, visitors from all over, mysterious wanderers, more than one world-famous writer, Civil War heroes, murderers, rustlers . . . even a flesh-and-blood Haint. Tarnation, without him&#x2014;and the Good Lord&#x2014;we would have for sure lost our farm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A Haint? What&#x2019;s a Haint?<br> <br>Abbie laughed again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a term we used on Hazel Creek to describe a ghost&#x2014;or a person whose soul was haunted. You know, hainted&#x2014;a Haint.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds like an interesting person&#x2014;and a mysterious place.&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded, looking back over the mountains. &#x201c;It was&#x2014;and so is he.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Haint?&#x201d; I inquired.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, the Lord. He&#x2019;s mysterious and works in wonderful ways. And Hazel Creek certainly had more than her share of massacres, secrets, adventures, and whodunits.&#x201d; She turned to look at me. &#x201c;Got time to hear about a few?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure!&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned back toward the mountains and, with a faraway look, began . . .</p><h2>Dreamer's Pool (Blackthorn &amp; Grim)</h2><p><b>Award-winning author Juliet Marillier &#x201c;weaves magic, mythology, and folklore into every sentence on the page&#x201d; (The Book Smugglers).

Tomorrow would be midsummer, not that a person could tell rain from shine in this cesspit. I&#x2019;d been here a year. A whole year of filth and abuse and being shoved back down the moment I lifted myself so much as an inch. Tomorrow, at last, I&#x2019;d get my chance to speak out. Tomorrow I would tell my story.</p><p>In the darkness of the cell opposite, Grim began muttering. A moment later the door down at the guard post creaked open. How Grim could tell the guards were coming before we heard them was a mystery, but he always knew. The muttering was a kind of shield. At night, when the place belonged to us prisoners, he spoke more sense.</p><p>A jingle of metal; footsteps approaching. Long strides, heavy footed. Slammer. Usually, when he came, we&#x2019;d shrink back into the shadows, hoping not to draw his attention. Today I stood by the bars waiting. My time in this place had broken me down. The person they&#x2019;d locked up last summer was gone, and she wasn&#x2019;t coming back. But tomorrow I&#x2019;d speak for that woman, the one I had been. Tomorrow I&#x2019;d tell the truth, and if the council had any sense of right and wrong, they&#x2019;d make sure justice was done. The thought of that kept me on my feet even when Slammer went into his little routine, smashing his club into the bars of each cell in turn, liking the way it made us jump. Yelling his stupid names for us, names that had stuck like manure on a boot, so we even used them for one another, Grim and I being the only exceptions. Peering in to make sure we looked sufficiently cowed and beaten down.</p><p>&#x201c;Bonehead!&#x201d; The club crashed against Grim&#x2019;s bars. &#x201c;Stop your stupid driveling!&#x201d;</p><p>At the back of his cell Grim was a dark bundle against the wall, head down on drawn-up knees, hands over ears, still muttering away. Funny thing was, if Slammer had opened that cell door just a crack, Grim could have killed him with his bare hands and not raised a sweat doing it. I&#x2019;d seen him at night, pulling himself up on the bars, standing on his hands, keeping himself strong as if there might be giants to kill in the morning.</p><p>The guard turned my way. &#x201c;Slut!&#x201d; <i>Crash!</i></p><p>I wished I had the strength to keep quite still as the club thumped the bars right by my head, but the three hundred and fifty-odd days had taken their toll, and I couldn&#x2019;t help wincing. Slammer didn&#x2019;t move on to the cell next door as usual. He stopped on the other side of the bars, squinting through at me. Pig.</p><p>&#x201c;Got something to tell you, Slut.&#x201d; His voice was a confidential murmur now; it made my skin crawl.</p><p>Slammer liked playing games. He was always teasing the men with talk of messages from home, or hinting at opportunities for getting out. He was a liar. They all were.</p><p>&#x201c;Something you won&#x2019;t like,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;If I won&#x2019;t like it, why would I want to hear it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll want to hear this.&#x201d; He put his face right next to the bars, so close I could smell his foul breath. Not that it made much difference; the whole place stank of unwashed bodies and overflowing latrine buckets and plain despair. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re here to tell me that tomorrow&#x2019;s the midsummer council, don&#x2019;t trouble yourself. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for this since the day I was thrown into this festering dump.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Slammer in a voice I liked even less than the previous one. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it.&#x201d;</p><p>Meaning, I could tell, exactly the opposite. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re interested.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean, <i>that&#x2019;s just it</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ll you give me if I tell you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This,&#x201d; I said, and spat in his face. He was asking for it.</p><p>&#x201c;Euch!&#x201d; He wiped a sleeve across his cheek. &#x201c;Filthy whore!&#x201d;</p><p>Filthy was right; but not the other. I&#x2019;d never given myself willingly in here, and I&#x2019;d never been paid for the privilege. The guards had taken what they wanted in those first days, when I&#x2019;d still been fresh; when I&#x2019;d looked and felt and smelled like a woman. They didn&#x2019;t bother me now. None of them was desperate enough to want the rank, skinny, lice-ridden creature I&#x2019;d become. Which meant I had nothing at all to offer Slammer in return for whatever scrap of information he was teasing me with.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last time you&#x2019;ll spit at me, Slut!&#x201d; hissed Slammer.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right for once, since I&#x2019;ll be out of this place tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, but his eyes stayed cold. &#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d; The way he said it meant I was wrong. But I wasn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d been told my name was on the list. The law said a chieftain couldn&#x2019;t keep prisoners in custody more than a year without hearing their cases. And with all the chieftains of Laigin here, even a wretch like Mathuin, who didn&#x2019;t deserve the title of chieftain, would abide by the rules.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be out, all right,&#x201d; Slammer said. &#x201c;But not the way you think.&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, he was enjoying this, whatever it was. My mouth went dry. Over in the cell opposite, Grim had fallen silent. I couldn&#x2019;t see him now; Slammer&#x2019;s bulk took up all my space. I forced myself to keep quiet. I wouldn&#x2019;t give him the satisfaction of hearing me beg.</p><p>&#x201c;You must have really got up Mathuin&#x2019;s nose,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What did you do to make him so angry?&#x201d; Perhaps knowing he wouldn&#x2019;t get an answer, Slammer went right on. &#x201c;Overheard a little exchange. Someone wants you out of the way <i>before</i> the hearing, not after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Out of the way?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone wants to make sure your case never goes before the council. First thing in the morning, you&#x2019;re to be disposed of. Quick, quiet, final. Name crossed off the list. No need to bother the chieftains with any of it.&#x201d; He was scrutinizing me between the bars, waiting for me to weep, collapse, scream defiance.</p><p>&#x201c;Why have you told me this?&#x201d; A lie. A trick. He was full of them. I willed my heart to slow down, but it was hopping all over the place like a creature in a trap.</p><p>&#x201c;What, you&#x2019;d sooner not know until I drag you out there in the morning and someone gives you a nasty surprise? Little knife in the heart, pair of thumbs to the throat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better say your prayers, Slut.&#x201d; He moved off along the row. &#x201c;Poxy!&#x201d; <i>Smash!</i> &#x201c;Strangler!&#x201d; <i>Crash!</i> &#x201c;Frog Spawn!&#x201d; <i>Slam!</i></p><p>Across the walkway, Grim was standing at the front of his cell, big hands wrapped around the bars.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you looking at?&#x201d; I snarled, turning away before my face could show him anything. The three hundred and fifty-odd marks stared back from the wall, mocking me. Not a count to freedom and justice after all; only a count to a swift and violent end. Because, deep down, I knew this must be true. Slammer didn&#x2019;t have the imagination to play a trick like this.</p><p>&#x201c;Lady?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut your mouth, Grim! I never want to hear your wretched voice again!&#x201d; I sank down on the straw pallet with its teeming population of insects. Even these fleas would live longer than me. I wished I could find that amusing. Instead, the anger built and built, as if the swarm of crawling things was inside me, breeding and multiplying and spreading out into every corner of my body until I was ready to burst. How could this be? I&#x2019;d held out here for one reason and one reason only. I&#x2019;d endured all those poxy days and wretched, vermin-infested nights, I&#x2019;d listened to that idiot Grim mumbling away, I&#x2019;d seen and heard enough to give me a lifetime of nightmares. And I&#x2019;d stayed alive. I&#x2019;d held on to one thing: the knowledge that eventually I&#x2019;d get my day to be heard. Midsummer. The council. It was the law. Curse it! I&#x2019;d done it all for this day, this one day! They couldn&#x2019;t take it away!</p><p>The crawling things broke out all at once. From a distance, detached, I watched myself hurling objects around the cell, heard myself shouting invective, felt myself hitting my head on the wall, slamming my shoulder into the bars, ripping at my hair, my mouth stretched in a big ugly square of hatred. Felt the tears and snot and blood dribbling down my face, felt the filth and shame and utter pointlessness of it all, knew, finally, what it was that drove so many in here to cut and maim and, eventually, make an end of themselves. &#x201c;Slammer, you liar!&#x201d; I screamed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re full of shit! It&#x2019;s not true, it can&#x2019;t be! Come back here and say it again, go on, I dare you! Filthy vermin! Rancid scum!&#x201d;</p><p>It was catching, this kind of thing. Pretty soon everyone in the cells was shouting along with me, half of them yelling at Slammer and the other guards and the unfairness of everything, the rest abusing me for disturbing them, though there wasn&#x2019;t much to disturb in here. Crashes and thumps told me I wasn&#x2019;t the only one throwing things.</p><p>All the while, there was Grim, standing up against his own bars, silent and still, watching me.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you staring at, dimwit?&#x201d; I wiped a sleeve across my face. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you hear me? Mind your own business!&#x201d;</p><p>He retreated to the back of his cell, not because of anything I had said, but because down at the end of the walkway the door had crashed open again and the guards were coming through at a run. It was the usual when we got noisy: buckets of cold water hurled in to drench us. If that didn&#x2019;t work, someone would be dragged out and made an example of, and this time around that person would have to be me. Not that a beating made any difference. Not if Slammer had been telling the truth.</p><p>I got a bucket of slops. There was a bit of cursing from the others, but everyone stopped yelling, not wanting worse. The guards left, taking their empty buckets with them, and there I was, dripping, stinking, bruised and bleeding from my own efforts, with the buzzing insects of my fury still swarming inside me. The cell was a mess, and with wretched Grim over there, only a few paces away, there was nowhere to hide. Nowhere I could curl up in a ball with the blankets over my head and cry. Nowhere I could give way to the terror of knowing that in the morning I would die, and Mathuin would be alive and going about his daily business, free to do to other folk&#x2019;s families what he had done to mine. I would die with my loved ones unavenged.</p><p>I scrabbled on the floor, searching among the things I&#x2019;d hurled everywhere, and my fingers closed around the rusty nail. Those marks on the wall were mocking me; they were making a liar of me. I hated the story they told. I loathed the failure they showed me to be. Weak. Pathetic. A vow breaker. A loser. With the nail clutched in my fist I scratched between them, around them, over them, making the orderly groups of five, four vertical, one linking horizontal, into a chaotic mess of scribble. What was the point in hope when someone always snatched it away? Why bother telling the truth if nobody would listen? What use was going on when nobody cared if you lived or died?</p><p>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½</p><p>I waited for death. Thought how odd human nature was. All paths were barred, all doors closed. There was no escaping what was coming. And yet, when the guard known as Tiny&#x2014;a very tall man&#x2014;brought around the lumpy gray swill that passed for food in this place, I took my bowl and ate. We were always hungry. One or two of the men caught rats sometimes and chewed them raw. I&#x2019;d never had the stomach for that, though Strangler, in the cell next to mine, always offered me a share. In the early days we used to talk about food a lot; imagine the first meal we&#x2019;d have when they let us out. Fresh fish cooked over a campfire. Mutton-fat porridge. Roast duck with walnut stuffing. Carrot and parsnip mashed with butter. For me it was a chunk of bread and cheese or a crisp new apple. When I thought of that first bite my belly ached and so did my heart. Then I&#x2019;d got beaten down and worn out, like an old mattress with the stuffing gone to nothing, and I didn&#x2019;t care anymore. Same with the others; we were grateful for the swill, and thankful that Tiny didn&#x2019;t rattle our cages and scream at us. So, even when I was looking death in the eye, so to speak, I ate. Across the walkway, Grim was on his pallet, scooping up his own share and trying to watch me and avoid my eye at the same time.</p><p>The long day passed as they always did. Grim muttered to himself on and off, making no sense at all. Frog Spawn went through his list of all those who had offended him, and what he planned to do to them when he got out. It was a long list and we all knew it intimately, since he recited it every day. The others were quiet, though Poxy did ask me at one point if I was all right, and I snarled, &#x201c;What do you think?,&#x201d; making it clear I didn&#x2019;t want an answer.</p><p>I sat on the floor, trying out the pose Grim seemed to find most comforting when under threat, head on knees, arms around legs, eyes squeezed shut. The day before you died was the longest, slowest day ever. It gave you more time than you could possibly want to contemplate all the things you&#x2019;d got wrong, the chances you&#x2019;d missed, the errors you&#x2019;d made. It was long enough to convince the most hopeful person that there was no point in anything. If only this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if only that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if only I had my chance, my one chance to be heard&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Another round of swill told us it was getting on for nighttime; a person wouldn&#x2019;t know from the windows, which were kept shuttered. It was a long time since they&#x2019;d last let us out into the courtyard. Maybe Mathuin&#x2019;s men didn&#x2019;t know folk could die from lack of sunshine. Our only light came from a lantern down the end of the walkway.</p><p>Frog Spawn&#x2019;s ravings slowed, then stopped as he fell asleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Slut!&#x201d; called Strangler. &#x201c;Place won&#x2019;t be the same without you!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our lovely lady,&#x201d; put in Poxy, mostly mocking, a little bit serious. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll miss you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let the vermin take you without a fight, Slut,&#x201d; came the voice of Dribbles from down the far end. &#x201c;Give &#x2019;em your best, tooth and nail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I want your advice,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask for it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wake us up when they come for you,&#x201d; said Strangler. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give you a proper send-off. Worth a bucket or two of slops.&#x201d;</p><p>Grim wasn&#x2019;t saying anything, just sitting there gazing across at me, a big lump of a man with a filthy mane of hair, a bristling beard and sad eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop looking at me,&#x201d; I muttered, wondering how I was going to get through the night without going as crazy as Frog Spawn. If there was nothing I could do about this, why was my mind teeming with all the bad memories, all the wrongs I hadn&#x2019;t managed to put right? Why was the hate, the bitterness, the will for vengeance still burning in me, deep down, when the last hope was gone?</p><p>Finally they all slept; all but Grim and me. The lantern burned low. Soon we&#x2019;d be in darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;Lady?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you can&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I can what? Fly through stone walls? Charm the guards with my feminine wiles and make a miraculous escape? Wave a wand and turn them all into toads?&#x201d;</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t fix this, Grim. I wish I had a magic charm to set the world to rights. To see evil-doers punished and good men rewarded. To see the innocent protected and the guilty judged. But it doesn&#x2019;t work that way.&#x201d; I looked across at him hunched on his pallet. &#x201c;I hope you surv...</p></p><h2>Dinosaur Cove #2: Charge of the Triceratops</h2><p>A new series for dino-loving adventurers!<br><br>Tom and Jamie can't believe their luck when they find a secret entrance to a prehistoric world filled with dinosaurs!<br><br>The boys return to the dinosaur world looking for adventure.

Although she had leanings towards Homoeopathy during her student years, it was not until she visited the world-famous Dr J. T. Kent in the USA, and experienced great benefit from this therapy that she fully adopted this method of treatment in her practice. Having embarked upon a career as a Homoeopath, she studied the subject deeply and the more she learned the more she became convinced that it is the finest method of dealing with every type of ailment. Being a true healer she believed that every sufferer should know of Homoeopathy and in order to make it more widely known she wrote &#34;Homoeopathy for the First Aider&#34; which gives simple instructions for the treatment of injuries and common ailments.

Jack's small-town world in Ohio begins to unravel when he starts to unleash unintentional bursts of wizardry. When he recovers a powerful sword from an ancestor's grave, he begins to realize how different he really is. A battle with a wizard and some magic-laced conflicts at his high school keep the pages turning while the truth about Jack's destiny slowly emerges. The scene switches to Great Britain, where he learns that he must participate in a duel to the death against a mysterious opponent. Many details about the Weir are initially hidden from readers, as well as from Jack, so the gradual revelations about the society are involving and often surprising. Jack makes a fairly convincing hero. He is disbelieving at first and reluctant throughout, but ultimately finds a way to utilize his new powers without sacrificing his honor or basic decency. An appealing mixture of supporting characters includes relatives with various magical abilities, a couple of nonmagical but loyal friends, and an engaging assortment of villains. Occasional plot developments are unconvincing, as when Jack's protective aunt, an enchanter, takes him straight into the clutches of a wizard who clearly wants the young warrior in her power. For the most part, though, the teen's unavoidable involvement in the intricate world of the Weir is suspenseful and entertaining.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

C. Sproul. "Does this mean that 15 billion years ago the universe exploded from non-being into being? Then what exploded?" In Not a Chance Sproul takes a hard look at such conundrums: Just what is chance? Can it account for what is?<br>As a respected Christian apologist, theologian, and philosopher, R. C. Sproul might be expected to find causation through chance a hard pill to swallow. But in Not a Chance we learn that he is not alone.<br>Among others troubled by chance probability ... David Hume: "Chance is only our ignorance of real causes"; Charles Darwin: "I cannot look at the universe as a result of blind chance."; Albert Einstein: "Quantum physics is certainly imposing, but an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing ... I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice."<br>In a lively dialog with modern thinkers from Hume to Niels Bohr and Carl Sagan, Not a Chance consults laws of logic, linguistic and scientific theory, and mathematical understandings to probe the cause-effect relationship.<br>Not a Chance invites all students of life to approach, with eyes open and mind alert, the wobbly pedestal from which chance rules modern cosmology.</p><p>R.

Burroughs (1914-1997)&#x2014;guru of the Beat Generation, controversial&nbsp;ï¿½minence grise of the international avant-garde, dark prophet, and blackest of black humor satirists&#x2014;had a range of influence rivaled by few post-World War II writers. His many books include <b>Naked Lunch</b>, <b>Queer</b>, <b>Exterminator!</b>, <b>The Cat Inside</b>, <b>The Western Lands</b>, and <b>Interzone</b>.In an introduction, Burroughs observes that he wrote this heretofore unpublished picaresque novel in 1951, well before Naked Lunch established his reputation. He reveals that the book had its genesis in a terrible event: his accidental shooting to death of his wife, Joan, a tragedy that released the black wellsprings of his talent. The narrative recounts the hallucinatory life of William Lee, an American in Mexico City in the 1940s and his journey to Ecuador with his reluctant lover, Eugene Allerton, in search of the drug Yage. Lee is Burroughs after the killing, weighed down by guilt, drugs, lust and despair; seeking lethe. Admirerers will find an early exposition of Burroughs's later themes here, as well as a strain of gallows humor. The work is almost cinematic as it unfolds; the author is not yet experimenting with the meaninglessness of language, and, indeed it is thin in both thought and expression. This is the first of a series of Burroughs's works to be issued by Viking. Foreign rights: Andrew Wylie Agency.

In over four hundred full-colour photographs of quaint country homes, lush gardens, simple decorations, and traditional dishes and recipes, Japan Country Living presents the lifestyle of the Japanese countryside as it was yesterday and describes the transformation into a present-day urban living.</p><p><blockquote>One tends to forget the simplicity and beauty of the traditional way of Japanese life, when meals came direct from the land or sea, when clothes were made at home after the day's labors were done, and when utensils and even homes were crafted from materials that were close at hand.</blockquote> <i>Japan Country Living: Spirit, Tradition, Style</i> is the perfect antidote to city living--whether the city is Tokyo, New York, or anywhere in between.

This book offers a glimpse into the dark mind of a living monster. &#34;To open this book is to open a peephole into hell&#34;.--Associated Press. Photographs.</p><p>Randy Kraft is believed to have committed more than 60 murders before he was apprehended by California troopers in 1983. He kept a meticulous scorecard and photos of his killings in his small brown Toyota. The young men died in agony--tortured with an automobile cigarette lighter, often impaled and sexually mutilated. Surprisingly, though, Kraft is not very famous. Perhaps that's because he killed only male hitchhikers and patrons of gay bars. Or perhaps it's because he never spoke about his crimes: he maintained the winsome smile and shy-guy pose that had served him well as a computer consultant in Orange County. Even his lover of many years, a gourmet candy maker who bought a house with Kraft, never suspected.

Forty-five million called him emperor, and he commanded a nation that was the richest, most cultured, and advanced on earth. No army could stand against his impeccably trained, brilliantly led forces, and his continued sweep across Europe seemed inevitable. <br><br>Early that year, bolstered by his successes, Napoleon turned his attentions toward Moscow, helming the largest invasion in human history. Surely, Tsar Alexander&#x2019;s outnumbered troops would crumble against this mighty force. <br> <br>But another powerful and ancient enemy awaited Napoleon&#x2019;s men in the Russian steppes. Virulent and swift, this microscopic foe would bring the emperor to his knees. <br> <br>Even as the Russians retreated before him in disarray, Napoleon found his army disappearing, his frantic doctors powerless to explain what had struck down a hundred thousand soldiers. The emperor&#x2019;s vaunted military brilliance suddenly seemed useless, and when the Russians put their own occupied capital to the torch, the campaign became a desperate race through the frozen landscape as troops continued to die by the thousands. Through it all, with tragic heroism, Napoleon&#x2019;s disease-ravaged, freezing, starving men somehow rallied, again and again, to cries of &#x201c;Vive l&#x2019;Empereur!&#x201d;<br> <br>Yet Talty&#x2019;s sweeping tale takes us far beyond the doomed heroics and bloody clashes of the battlefield. <i>The Illustrious Dead</i> delves deep into the origins of the pathogen that finally ended the mighty emperor&#x2019;s dreams of world conquest and exposes this &#x201c;war plague&#x2019;s&#x201d; hidden role throughout history.

As unsightly family secrets spill, Spenser feels like he's in a Tennessee Williams play. Then someone on two legs takes a bullet, and the mystery gets tense. Spenser gets plenty of sarcastic mileage out of upper-class horse-country twits, crooked security guards, dumb jocks gone to seed, and wily Southern lawyers, and the story saunters well. What's best are the endless wisecracks, the unflattering thumbnail character sketches, and sharp sentences like this one: "Like all jockeys, he was about the size of a ham sandwich, except for his hands, which appeared to be those of a stonemason." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Cd's 6 1/2 hours<br>Read by Joe Mantegna<br><br>Spenser is back and embroiled in a deceptively dangerous and multi-layered case: someone has been killing racehorses at stables across the south, and the Boston P.I. travels to Georgia to protect the two-year old destined to become the next Secretariat.<br><br>When Spenser is approached by Walter Clive, president of the Three Fillies Stables, to find out who is threatening his horse Hugger Mugger, he can hardly say no: he's been doing pro bono work for so long his cupboards are just about bare.

Then, to save the body of the woman he loved, he had to attack mighty Phundahl, and its evil, beautiful ruler.Edgar Rice Burroughs fame stems from the creation of Tarzan and the Barsoom science fiction series. He was born on September 1, 1875 in Chicago, Illinois, and entered military service in 1895. Two years later, he was diagnosed with a heart problem and was discharged. He drifted from job to job and in 1911, he found work selling pencil sharpeners. Because he had plenty of free time during this period, he started reading pulp fiction magazines. He thought that if people were getting paid for writing such rot, then he could write stories which were just as rotten. After seven years of being paid low wages he began writing his own fiction. The first Tarzan and John Carter stories were published in 1912.</p><h2>Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush</h2><p>The former cousel to President Nixon provides a stinging critique of the current Bush administration, its obsession with secrecy, and its willingness to deceive the American people, emphasizing the president&#39;s emphasis on image over substance, mistrustful personality, imperial governing and flawed decision making, and his abuses of national security secrecy. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>The most facile presidential comparison one could make for George W. Bush would be his father, who presided over a war in Iraq and a struggling economy. Some "neocons" reject the parallel and compare Bush to his father's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, citing a plainspoken quality and a belief in deep tax cuts. But John Dean goes further back, seeing in Bush all the secrecy and scandal of Dean's former boss, the notorious Richard Nixon. The difference, as the title of Dean's book indicates, is that Bush is a heck of a lot worse. While the book provides insightful snippets of the way Nixon used to do business, it offers them to shed light on the practices of Bush. In Dean's estimation, the secrecy with which Bush and Dick Cheney govern is not merely a preferred system of management but an obsessive strategy meant to conceal a deeply troubling agenda of corporate favoritism and a dramatic growth in unchecked power for the executive branch that put at risk the lives of American citizens, civil liberties, and the Constitution. Dean sets out to make his point by drawing attention to several areas about which Bush and Cheney have been tight-lipped: the revealing by a "senior White House official" of the identity of an undercover CIA operative whose husband questioned the administration, the health of Cheney, the identity of Cheney's energy task force, the information requested by the bi-partisan 9/11 commission, Bush's business dealings early in his career, the creation of a "shadow government", wartime prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, and scores more. He theorizes that the truth about these and many other situations, including the decision to go to war in Iraq, will eventually surface and that Bush and Cheney's secrecy is a thus far effective means of keep a lid on a rapidly multiplying set of lies and scandals that far outstrip the misdeeds that led directly to Dean's former employer resigning in disgrace. Dean's charges are impassioned and more severe than many of Bush's most persistent critics. But those charges are realized only after careful reasoning and steady logic by a man who knows his way around scandal and corruption. <i>--John Moe</i>Former White House counsel and New York Times bestselling author John Dean reveals how the Bush White House has set America back decades-employing a worldview and tactics of deception that will do more damage to the nation than Nixon at his worst.</p><h2>Bear Feels Sick</h2><p>Huge colorful illustrations.

The tales these spices could tell: of lavish Renaissance banquets perfumed with cloves, and flimsy sailing ships sent around the world to secure a scented prize; of cinnamon-dusted custard tarts and nutmeg-induced genocide; of pungent elixirs and the quest for the pepper groves of paradise. <br><br>The Taste of Conquest offers up a riveting, globe-trotting tale of unquenchable desire, fanatical religion, raw greed, fickle fashion, and mouthwatering cuisine&#x2013;in short, the very stuff of which our world is made. In this engaging, enlightening, and anecdote-filled history, Michael Krondl, a noted chef turned writer and food historian, tells the story of three legendary cities&#x2013;Venice, Lisbon, and Amsterdam&#x2013;and how their single-minded pursuit of spice helped to make (and remake) the Western diet and set in motion the first great wave of globalization.<br><br>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the world&#x2019;s peoples were irrevocably brought together as a result of the spice trade. Before the great voyages of discovery, Venice controlled the business in Eastern seasonings and thereby became medieval Europe&#x2019;s most cosmopolitan urban center. Driven to dominate this trade, Portugal&#x2019;s mariners pioneered sea routes to the New World and around the Cape of Good Hope to India to unseat Venice as Europe&#x2019;s chief pepper dealer. Then, in the 1600s, the savvy businessmen of Amsterdam &#x201c;invented&#x201d; the modern corporation&#x2013;the Dutch East India Company&#x2013;and took over as spice merchants to the world.<br><br>Sharing meals and stories with Indian pepper planters, Portuguese sailors, and Venetian foodies, Krondl takes every opportunity to explore the world of long ago and sample its many flavors. The spice trade and its cultural exchanges didn&#x2019;t merely lend kick to the traditional Venetian cookies called peverini, or add flavor to Portuguese sausages of every description, or even make the Indonesian rice table more popular than Chinese takeout in trendy Amsterdam. No, the taste for spice of a few wealthy Europeans led to great crusades, astonishing feats of bravery, and even wholesale slaughter.<br><br>As stimulating as it is pleasurable, and filled with surprising insights, The Taste of Conquest offers a fascinating perspective on how, in search of a tastier dish, the world has been transformed.</p><p>Michael Krondl is a chef, food writer, and author of Around the American Table: Treasured Recipes and Food Traditions from the American Cookery Collections of the New York Public Library and The Great Little Pumpkin Cookbook.

He lives in New York City.I Antichi <br><br>What I remember best from that dinner on Campo San Maurizio are the canoce, a tangle of milky pink sea creatures spilling across a great silver platter. And Luca, looming in the low kitchen doorway, in an outfit of leather pants, royal blue velvet blouse, and Day-Glo orange boots, a huge grin splitting his satyr&#x2019;s face as he paused dramatically to hold up the dish so that we might admire his succulent prize. Canoce are about the size of a fat man&#x2019;s index finger and belong to the same family of tasty exoskeletal sea life as shrimp and saltwater crayfish; however, they are distinctly more buglike in appearance, lacking the bright color and exuberant claws of other crustaceans. In flavor, though, they are far more delicate, infused with sweetness and brininess in exquisite balance. When they arrive at the table, I give up on my knife and fork so that I can methodically rip each luscious beast apart to extract its sweet belly and slurp on my fingers to secure each salty drip. I try to remember the instructions from a pamphlet on etiquette published in 1483, when everyone ate with their hands: &#x201c;Eat with the three fingers, do not take morsels of excessive size and do not stuff your mouth with both hands.&#x201d; Success is elusive. <br><br>Like most Italian cooking today, the canoce recipe is simple: the crustaceans are bathed in a little olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. It is Venetian food at its most elemental, a dish that comes from the bounty of the lagoon that fed local fishermen long before Venice became Europe&#x2019;s pepper dealer and continued to do so long after the city was washed up in the spice trade. The pepper is still there, but there&#x2019;s not even a trace of the other seasonings&#x2014;the ginger, the cinnamon, the nutmeg, the cloves&#x2014;that once filled the city&#x2019;s great galleys and suffused her suppers with Oriental scents. It&#x2019;s as if the ancient town can no longer recall yesterday&#x2019;s spiced debauch and instead, as the old often do, has retreated to the memories of her youth, before the parvenu aristocrats began to dress her up with baubles from abroad. Luca explains that this method of cooking canoce is more popolare, of the people, the way the old ladies make them, the only ones who can still make Venetian food. The recollection of feasts gone by fades the rake&#x2019;s smile to melancholy. <br><br>I had come to Venice to try to pry off her mask, to uncover some of the antique flavors, to sniff out her ancient peppery smells. I figured Luca could make the introductions. After all, he has spent his forty-something years consorting with the old dowager on the lagoon. Along the way, he has reproduced Renaissance feasts complete with trained bears, swordfights, and period trumpet serenades, where the gilded pheasants and cinnamon-scented ravioli were served from ornate platters and golden bowls. Although he is more a jack-of-all- trades than a Renaissance man, he has often dressed the part of the latter. Imagine Paul Bunyan in silk tights topped by an exquisite doublet of pink and gold. In other towns, Luca Colferai might have been a punk rocker in his youth, but here, his rebellion took the form of organizing erotic poetry festivals and resurrecting Casanova. So you can understand that when his grandiloquent dinner invitation arrived, I could hardly refuse. <br><br>One of Luca&#x2019;s many roles is to play a guiding spirit to I Antichi, a confraternity of like-minded families known as a compagnia de calza (literally, &#x201c;society of the stocking&#x201d;). &#x201c;Our compagnia is made up of a small lunatic fringe who just want to have fun during Carnevale&#x201d; is how Luca describes his companions. In fact, the society&#x2019;s mandate, to organize celebrations during Carnival, is fully approved and authorized by the Venetian municipal government. Given that this is Venice, the idea goes back to the sixteenth century, when groups of elite young men formed these associations to throw parties during Carnival. This was a time when the city&#x2019;s commercial prowess, and the spice trade in particular, was under siege. To the sons of privilege, drinking and whoring till dawn seemed much more sensible than risking their lives in the increasingly precarious pepper business. <br><br>The original I Antichi was founded by a group of Venetian nobles in 1541 with the motto Divertire divertendosi, which might be roughly translated as &#x201c;Throw parties so you can party.&#x201d; The group was reinvented by a Venetian lawyer and antiquarian named Paolo Zancopï¿½ in the late 1970s and subsequently passed into Luca&#x2019;s hands upon the founder&#x2019;s death. Zancopï¿½&#x2019;s residence, where our canoce feast was held, has become a kind of clubhouse for I Antichi, presided over by the effervescent presence of his Brazilian widow, Jurubeba. <br><br>Emptying yet another bottle of fizzy Prosecco, Luca recounts a golden past of grand regattas and mask-filled balls. The membership of I Antichi ranges from street sweepers to multimillionaires, from butchers to poets. They come together for the many official festivals that mark the Venetian calendar: for the Festa della Salute, which commemorates the end of the plague of 1631, when a third of Venice perished; for the Festa di Redentore, another party in memory of an epidemic; for the Festa della Sensa, when Venice recalls a time when the doge, the elected Venetian leader, would symbolically marry the sea; and, of course, for Carnevale, the pre-Lenten festival that overruns Venice and can seem as execrable as a plague when the narrow alleys swarm with the tourist hordes. The menu for every holiday follows age-old traditions: cured, spiced mutton, for the Salute; artichokes for the Sensa; bigoli for the Redentore. <br><br>Jurubeba interrupts Luca&#x2019;s reminiscences to consult on the state of our bigoli. (The canoce were only one course among many.) He breaks off midsentence to attend to the important matter at hand. Bigoli are a kind of thick whole wheat spaghetti that are typically served entangled in a sauce of caramelized onions and anchovies, the saltiness of the fish and sweetness of the onion providing the perfect, if unsubtle, condiment for the rough pasta. They are very traditional, especially to the Jews of the Ghetto Nuovo, the original &#x201c;ghetto.&#x201d; (The Jewish variant uses garlic instead of onions.) But today, it seems, all that&#x2019;s left of the Ghetto&#x2019;s ancient community are Hassidic Jews from Brooklyn&#x2014;and they know about as much about bigoli as they do about prosciutto. These days, there is little traditional food to be found in Venice. When I invite Luca to a restaurant, he grimaces, insisting that there are no more &#x201c;honest&#x201d; restaurants left, that they&#x2019;re all for the tourists now. <br><br>All the same, Venetian food hasn&#x2019;t entirely disappeared (yet), and if you dig hard enough, you can still unearth hints and clues of what food might have tasted like two hundred, five hundred, even a thousand years ago. Many restaurants still serve sarde in saor, a dish of fried sardines mounded with onions and raisins, seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and occasionally even cinnamon. Its combination of sweet and sour is typical of the Middle Ages; there&#x2019;s even a fourteenth-century recipe for much the same dish. You can also taste the past in the confections called peverini, sold in every Venetian pasticceria. They are barely sweet with molasses but distinctly seasoned with pepper, the pungency a faint echo of the city&#x2019;s past renown as spice supplier to the Western world. <br><br>Still, most of the food that Venetians call their own, the cooking of their grandmothers, is of much more recent vintage. In Marco Polo&#x2019;s day, our canoce would have been showered with a medieval blend of spices on top of today&#x2019;s salt and pepper; even as late as the seventeen hundreds, Casanova sprinkled his pasta with sugar and cinnamon. Indeed, the very idea of Venetian food as a regional Italian cuisine is largely an invention of the nineteenth century, much like the Italian state itself. It was only when Venice lost her overseas empire that her cuisine became dependent on local &#x201c;Italian&#x201d; ingredients. The occasional spiced dishes of the Renaissance held on, but only as obscure local specialties. Pelegrino Artusi, who wrote the nineteenth-century bible of Italian bourgeois cooking, is bemused and a little horrified when he writes of the way spices were used in the past.<br><br> While there&#x2019;s no way to know just how the food of the past tasted (the meat, the wine, even the onions, were different from what we have today), the spiced mutton served at the festival of the Madonna della Salute probably comes the closest in flavor to the food eaten by Shakespeare&#x2019;s merchants of Venice. Preparations for the November holiday begin in the spring, when the meat is prepared by curing a castrated ram with salt, pepper, and cloves before it is smoked and then air-dried for several months. It is still exported from Dalmatia (better known today as the countries of Albania and Croatia), as it would have been when the ancient republic used the preserved meat to feed her sailors. The flavor is strong and complex&#x2014;and anachronistic. It is entirely alien to Luca&#x2019;s four-hour feast of simply seasoned bigoli, canoce, roast triglie (red mullets), shrimp, and grilled radicchio and a world apart from the simple dessert of mascarpone and biscotti that arrived to finish our memorable evening. <br><br>I can&#x2019;t help but see a parallel between today&#x2019;s cooking, with its absence of spice, and the general amnesia you find in Venice about the importance of the spice trade. It didn&#x2019;t used to be like that. When Venetians found out that the Portuguese had arrived in India, at the very source of the pepper that made the city&#x2019;s economy hum, many panicked. The loss of the spice trade &#x201c;would be like the loss of milk and nourishment to an infant,&#x201d; wrote the spice dealer Girolamo Priuli in his journal in July 1501. And in many ways, it was, though it wouldn&#x2019;...</p><h2>Before You Hit Send: Preventing Headache and Heartache</h2><p><p><strong>When will we learn?</strong></p><p>With every sunrise we are given plenty of new examples of people &#x201c;Hitting Send&#x201d; and soon regretting it.

Fanny is fascinated by everything, from the trial of the thugs and the efficacy of opium on headaches to the adorning of a Hindu bride. To read her is to get as close as one can to a true picture of early colonial India - the sacred and the profane, the violent and the beautiful, the straight-laced sahibs and the more eccentric &#34;White Mughals&#34; who fell in love with India and did their best, like Fanny, to build bridges across cultures.</p><p>Fanny Parks (1794-1875) went to India in 1822 and spent the next 24 years travelling the country.

The author describes his struggle with hypothyroidism and how eventually he regained his health using a medication called liothyronine sodium, which is a synthetic equivalent of the thyroid hormone T3. The use of T3 finally enabled the author to make a complete recovery, although there were many lessons that he needed to learn about T3 in order to regain his health. This book covers a vast amount of technical and practical information relating to T3 medication and details how the author applied this information in order to get well. The book has a foreword by Dr. John C. Lowe, who has this to say about the book: &#34;Paul Robinson has written a book chock-full of information on T3 that is vitally important to many people. I believe that reading &#39;Recovering with T3 My Journey from Hypothyroidism to Good Health Using the T3 Thyroid Hormone&#39; will be a splendid experience for thousands of people, whether clinicians, patients, patient advocates, or patients&#39; loved ones.&#34; &#39;Recovering with T3&#39; is quite simply essential reading for any patient and their doctor if they are considering the use of the T3 thyroid hormone. This revised edition contains many enhancements and improvements over the original Recovering with T3 book released at the end of 2011. Enhancements were made due to some valuable patient feedback and the experience of thousands of thyroid patients with the T3 dosage management process and the highly effective circadian T3 method (CT3M). The Revised Edition of the book is the result of these improvements, some simple typo fixes and the addition of a much-requested index. &#34;Thank you!&#34; to thyroid patients around the world for the wonderful feedback that has enabled the creation of this Revised Edition with an index.</p><p></p><h2>The Illustrated Herbal (Manuscripts)</h2><p>Studies the development of manuscript and printed herbals, their making and decoration, and their medicinal significance and reproduces over sixty illustrations from forty-three different herbals</p><p>As more gardeners become interested in growing herbs, a general curiosity about herbal lore is increasing. This expanded version of an important book traces the origins of those ancient illustrated compendiums of plants known as herbals. And despite their obvious scholarship, Blunt and Raphael have put together a readable account. Delving into essential changes in the depictions of herbs, they cite early Greek texts and then move on to an eighteenth-century French <i>herbier</i> and British botanical texts. These fascinating sources--gleaned from the archives of numerous libraries and museums--have yielded simple, stylized drawings and exquisitely detailed engravings and paintings, presenting much to be savored. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>One Hand for Yourself, One for the Ship: The Essentials of Single-Handed Sailing</h2><p>Tristan Jones has logged more miles--and more adventure--sailing single-handed than any other person alive in our time. He has crossed the Atlantic many times, often alone, and has circumnavigated the globe in small boats. One Hand for Yourself, One for the Ship is a course on single-handed sailing by the man most qualified to give it. Tristan Jones offers his highly personal perspective on both the science and the art of this ultimate challenge. It is a book for every sailor, giving the novice and the experienced sailor alike invaluable information and advice simply and with humor. Rich with anecdote and detail, written as only Tristan Jones can write, this is the handbook to turn to when planning a trip and to refer to when sailing.</p><p>Tristan Jones was born aboard his father&#39;s sailing ship as it rounded Cape Horn. He grew up in Wales and later joined the Royal Navy. After he left the service, he began a career of yacht deliveries and, aboard his own yachts, undertook some of the most ambitious small craft journeys ever made. He has written many books about his incredible adventures and is one of the best-loved nautical writers today. His collection of stories Yarns is also published by Sheridan House.A reference handbook of the essentials of single-handed sailing written for novice and experienced sailors. Jones offers information and advice on the science and art of solo sailing with humorous anecdotes and details. Topics range from accommodations and small-craft cooking to celestial navigation and hazardous conditions (<i>Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal</i>)<br><br>Tristan Jones needs no introduction to anyone interested in sailing and yachts. He has logged more miles and more adventure sailing alone than any other person alive in our time. He has crossed the Atlantic many times, often alone and has circumnavigated the globe in small boats. As such, One Hand for Yourself, One of the Ship, sub-titled The Essentials of Singlehanded Sailing is a course on singlehanded sailing by the man most qualified to give it. There are of course numerous books on singlehanded sailing, but few so readable and full of sheer commonsense and experience, laced with the highly personal perspective of a man who has lived his life on the sea. The book encompasses arguably every aspect of preparation, fear and technique needed for a person to sail alone, from rigs and rigging to catching fish; celestial navigation to stay alive. He even goes into great detail on the importance of taking along materials so that one can make an emergency mast in the event of demasting and tells you how to construct one. His advice regarding self-steering is something all cruising sailors should consider very carefully, His own vast experience has led him to believe that for serious cruising you should fit a wind-vane, preferably, in his own words, the Rolls-Royce of wind-vanes, the Aries. He says no electronic or electrical device that he has sailed with has proved 100 percent reliable and that in nine-tenths of the ports of the world, the hopes of finding someone who understands these things is about as realistic as the hope of getting Colonel Qaddafi to adopt the United States constitution. An invaluable book, written by a man described by the American magazine Motor Boat and Sailing as the Joshua Slocum of our age.

Everyone in Jamaica, from the prime minister in his gardens to the Rastafarian elders in Trench Town, listens to the latest reggae songs for an immediate line on the political and spiritual pulse of the island. <i>Reggae Bloodlines,</i> originally published in 1977 and here updated with a new afterword, was the first book to tell the story of the music of the Jamaican people and their spiritual nationality, the Brotherhood of Rastafari. It includes interviews with reggae's master musicians&#x2014;Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, Toots Hibbert, Big Youth, Peter Tosh, Agugstus Pablo, Max Romeo&#x2014;and Prime Minister Michael Manley; reportage on Jamaican politics; and it sorties into the nation's lush interior in search of the ganja fields of Kali Mountain and the legendary Maroon enclaves, still inhabited by the descendants of slave warriors. <i>Reggae Bloodlines</i> is not an encyclopedia of Jamaican style, nor a critical appraisal of its music&#x2014;it is a definitive portrait of a struggling nation and its musical heritage at the crucial turning point of decolonization. Packed with hundreds of astonishing photographs, <i>Reggae Bloodlines</i> captures the restless rhythm of reggae culture like no book before or since.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Paper Weaving: 46 Colorful, Dimensional Projects--Includes Full-Size Templates Inside &amp; Online Plus Practice Paper for One Project</h2><p><p><b>Perfect for Paper Lovers: A Traditional Technique with a Modern Twist!</b></p><p>Originating in Germany and refined in nineteenth-century Denmark and Norway, the charming, time-honored craft of paper weaving has been transformed by virtuoso paper crafters Anna and Lene Schepper into a modern art form with an amazing array of creative possibilities.</p><p>In <i>The Art of Paper Weaving</i>, Anna and Lene, creators of the blog PaperMatrix.dk, show how to get started with essential tools and techniques, then present instructions for 46 beautiful, colorful two- and three-dimensional projects from cones to stars to spheres, boxes, and beyond, in six gorgeous, inspiring themes: Love and Friendship, Celebrations, Magic Circus, Tivoli Gardens, Exotic Palace, and Advanced Designs.</p><p>In addition to full-size templates for each project, which are also available for download online, you'll find practice paper to make a rocket ship!</p><p><i>The Art of Paper Weaving</i> gives paper crafters of all skill levels the techniques they need to master the craft, incredible projects, and the inspiration they need to create something truly unique.</p></p><p><p><b>Anna and Lene Schepper</b> are the mother/daughter duo behind PaperMatrix (http://papermatrix.wordpress.com/), a blog dedicated to exploring and expanding the traditional art of paper weaving and braiding.

Original.</p><p><b>The story behind the book...</b><br>Okay, so how in the world did I catch over a thousand major league baseballs? And why have I written a book about it? Let me explain.<p>When I was little, I used to attend only a few major league baseball games each year. Of course I was always dying to catch a ball, just like the other 40,000 fans at the game. But it never happened. Other people caught balls. But not me.</p><p>I wanted to catch a ball more than anyone else at the ballpark, but unfortunately, I needed more than just a strong desire.</p><p>Looking back, it's no wonder why I never caught one. I usually arrived at the stadium after the game had begun, and my parents always hauled me off ("to beat traffic") before the game had ended. What's more, I used to sit in the middle of long rows of people, somehow expecting a ball to come right to me. I tell you, I didn't know anything. I needed someone to tell me what I was doing wrong, but there was no one I could ask.</p><p>I finally caught my first ball at Shea Stadium when I was 12. But even then, I had used some advice from a magazine article to help me get that ball. The article told me to "attend batting practice." Before reading that, I had never heard of batting practice.</p><p>The only useful ball-snagging advice I received was to show up at the stadium early. Everything else I figured out on my own.</p><p>That took years.</p><p>When I got old enough to go to games by myself, I went often, almost every night, in fact. I was also snagging at least one ball almost every time I went, often more.</p><p>As the weeks went by, I kept getting better and better at my newfound hobby. The balls poured in by the dozen. As the years rolled by, the balls poured in by the hundred.</p><p>During all this time, people who knew about my successful collection asked me what my secrets were. Do you think I was about to tell anyone?</p><p>Not a chance.</p><p>When I finally reached my goal of one thousand baseballs, I got a small about of publicity. There were a few articles written about me, and a radio station even called to do an interview.</p><p>In these few articles and interviews, I was always asked how I did it. But there's only so much that can be said in 500 words.</p><p>There were even a few "how to" articles written here and there about catching balls at games, but all they did was briefly state the obvious. This both frustrated and inspired me.</p><p>Now that I had my thousand baseballs, I decided that I no longer needed to withhold my secret strategies.</p><p>And so, the idea for this book was born.</p><p>Snagging baseballs at major league stadiums is nearly impossible if you don't know what you're doing. But if you do know, it's actually quite easy.</p><p>I have found that it's also one of the most rewarding hobbies. For me, catching a ball at a game brings one of the biggest thrills in life. Even though I now have 1,266 baseballs, my heart races when one even comes near me.</p><p>"How to Snag Major League Baseballs" tells everything you could possibly need to know in order to catch a ball at a game. I've held nothing back. It's all there.</p><p>Like I said, snagging balls is exciting and gut-wrenching, and I wrote this book to help others get to experience this thrill.</p><p>I wrote the book with kids in mind, but it is also intended for all you grown-ups out there, too.</p><p>Of course I can't offer a full money back guarantee, but I'd have to say that if you read this book and practice its advice seriously, there's almost no chance that you won't snag a baseball in the very near future. I snag balls just about every time I go to a game, and there's no reason why you shouldn't, too.</p><p>If you have a cool story about snagging a baseball or if you beat any of my ball-snagging records listed in the last chapter, I'd love to hear about it. Feel free to drop me a line.</p><p>-Zack Hample</p></p><h2>Satan, Cantor, And Infinity and Other Mind-Boggling Puzzles</h2><p>The author of What Is the Name of This Book? presents a compilation of more than two hundred challenging new logic puzzles--ranging from simple brainteasers to complex mathematical paradoxes.</p><p>In Smullyan's latest challenging collection of logic puzzles, the Sorcerer, a logician who uses logic so cleverly it seems like magic, visits an island where intelligent robots create other robots. King Zorn, Princess Annabelle, truth-telling knights and lying knaves lighten the presentation of puzzles as the Sorcerer explains the pioneering discoveries of mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918) who proved that there are different orders of infinity, and as he delves into paradoxes about probability, time and change. Smullyan ( The Lady or the Tiger? ) tosses in metapuzzles (which are solved on the basis of knowing that certain other puzzles can or cannot be solved) and explores self-referentiality, a property crucial to Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. The Sorcerer closes with a tale of how Satan is outwitted by a student of Cantor's. A mind-stretching entertainment for the serious, dedicated puzzle-solver. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Imitation of Christ</h2><p>This treasured book has brought peace to readers for many ages by showing how to follow the life of Christ to which all are called.

When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic. Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>Dark Tower: the Gunslinger: The Man in Black</h2><p>The exciting final chapter in the Dark Tower: Gunslinger saga is here!

In fact, Derek Leebaert argues in <i>Grand Improvisation</i>, the idea that a traditionally insular United States suddenly transformed itself into the leader of the free world is illusory, as is the notion that the British colossus was compelled to retreat. The United States and the U.K. had a dozen abrasive years until Washington issued a &#x201c;declaration of independence&#x201d; from British influence.

It is a dark and absorbing example of the Gothic sensibility and bracing satirical voice that are united in Flannery O'Conner's work. In it, the orphaned Francis Marion Tarwater and his cousins, the schoolteacher Rayber, defy the prophecy of their dead uncle--that Tarwater will become a prophet and will baptize Rayber's young son, Bishop. A series of struggles ensues: Tarwater fights an internal battle against his innate faith and the voices calling him to be a prophet while Rayber tries to draw Tarwater into a more "reasonable" modern world. Both wrestle with the legacy of their dead relatives and lay claim to Bishop's soul.<br><br>O'Connor observes all this with an astonishing combination of irony and compassion, humor and pathos.

When she died at the age of thirty-nine, America lost one of its most gifted writers at the height of her powers. O&#x2019;Connor wrote two novels, <i>Wise Blood</i> (1952) and <i>The Violent Bear It Away</i> (1960), and two story collections, <i>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</i> (1955) and <i>Everything That Rises Must Converge</i> (1964). Her <i>Complete Stories</i>, published posthumously in 1972, won the National Book Award that year, and in a 2009 online poll it was voted as the best book to have won the award in the contest&#x2019;s 60-year history. Her essays were published in <i>Mystery and Manners</i> (1969) and her letters in <i>The Habit of Being</i> (1979). In 1988 the Library of America published her <i>Collected Works</i>; she was the first postwar writer to be so honored. O&#x2019;Connor was educated at the Georgia State College for Women, studied writing at the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop, and wrote much of <i>Wise Blood</i> at the Yaddo artists&#x2019; colony in upstate New York.

With nothing left to lose, Kestrel and her twin brother, Bowman, do the unthinkable: they leave the city walls. Their only hope of rescuing the rest of their family is to find the key to the wind singer. Armed with bravery, wits, and determination, Kestrel, Bowman, and a tagalong classmate set off to find the key. Along the way they meet allies and foes, but in order to succeed in their quest, they must face the most sinister force of all: the evil spirit-lord, the Morah.</p><p>In the city of Aramanth, the mantra is, "Better today than yesterday. Better tomorrow than today." Harder work means the citizens of Aramanth can keep moving forward to improved life stations--from Gray tenements and Orange apartments, upwards to glorious mansions of White. Only some families, like the Haths, believe more in ideas and dreams than in endless toil and ratings. When Kestrel Hath decides she is through with the Aramanth work ethic, she is joined in her small rebellion by her twin brother Bowman and their friend Mumpo. Together, they set the orderly city on its ear by escaping Aramanth's walls for an adventure that takes them from city sewers to desert sandstorms. Guided by an archaic map, they know that if they can find the voice of the Wind Singer, an ancient and mysterious instrument that stands in the center of Aramanth, they can save their people from their dreamless existence. But the voice is guarded by the dreaded Morah and its legion of perfect killing machines, the Zars. Are three ragtag kids any match for an army of darkness? <p> Like Lois Lowry's <i>The Giver</i> and Philip Pullman's <i>The Golden Compass</i>, <i>The Wind Singer</i> is a rich, multilayered fantasy that can be read on many levels. With this first volume of a planned trilogy, British author William Nicholson deftly illustrates such fundamental values as tolerance and the importance of individuality, without sacrificing a bit of the novel's breathless adventure. Watch out, J.K. Rowling! If the rest of The Wind on Fire trilogy is as amazing as this debut, Nicholson's books may be the next hot English export.

He went on to study English Literature at Christ&#39;s College, Cambridge, graduating with a double First Class degree in 1970. After leaving university, William joined BBC television, where he worked as a documentary film maker. It was not long before William&#39;s talent was channelled into writing for television dramas and his professional writing career took off. William is perhaps best known as an experienced and successful Hollywood screenwriter, whose credits include the BAFTA award-winning SHADOWLANDS and Oscar-winning GLADIATOR. Nicholson&#39;s first trilogy for young readers, The Wind on Fire, met with universal acclaim. Nicholson has won the Smarties Gold Award and the Blue Peter Book Award.

Children are of course drawn to deep play--those activities that catapult them into an altered state of consciousness, where all their senses are engaged and for that moment life is timeless and fully absorbing. But few adults are conscious of how this form of deep play continues throughout adulthood.<p> For athletes, deep play could embody the extreme and spiritually rewarding feats of mountain climbing or scuba diving, explains Ackerman. For lovers, it could be the compelling dance of courtship. Some find the act of making soup from scratch a form of deep play. For Ackerman, deep play has meant swimming with dolphins, writing poetry, piloting planes, and making sojourns to remote locations and sacred places. "Swept up by the deeper states of play, one feels balanced, creative, focused," explains Ackerman. "Deep play is a fascinating hallmark of being human; it reveals our need to seek a special brand of transcendence, with a passion that makes thrill-seeking explicable, creativity possible, and religion inevitable."</p><p> Ackerman's writing and metaphors are most engaging when she uses her fascinating life experiences to characterize how adults can engage in the rapture and ecstasy of deep play. This is a fascinating new territory of discussion, which could forever alter your approach to play in daily life. --<i>Gail Hudson</i></p>"[Ackerman] brings such joy to the page.... The very act of reading this original, exultant, sage, poetic, and generous meditation on the importance of enchantment is deep play, and you can't ask that a book be anything more wonderful than that." --<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"A fascinating subject....

It was after a period in Saudi Arabia, which she found &#x2018;damaging physically and spiritually&#x2019; that Donna decided to move to Venice, where she has now lived for over twenty years.</p> <p>Her debut as a crime fiction writer began as a joke: talking in a dressing room in Venice&#x2019;s opera-house La Fenice after a performance, Donna and a singer friend were vilifying a particular German conductor. From the thought &#x2018;why don&#x2019;t we kill him?&#x2019; and discussion of when, where and how, the idea for <b>Death at La Fenice</b> took shape, and was completed over the next four months.</p> <p><b> Donna Leon is the crime reviewer for the London <b>Sunday Times</b>&nbsp;and is an opera expert.

Brigitte Fassbaender, one of the great mezzo-sopranos of our time, and now head of the Landestheater in Innsbruck, agreed to come out of retirement both to direct the opera and to play the part of the witch Azuneris (whose name combines the names of the two great Verdi villainesses Azucena and Amneris).</b></p>This is your basic police procedural set in Venice. It features a likeable, methodical detective, Guido Brunetti, who sacrifices his vacation in the mountains to track down a scam and the murderer of a banker disguised as a transvestite. Anna Fields reads the story in a hard-edged, gravelly voice, which fits the plot even if it doesn&#39;t please the ear. Donna Leon writes like a female Ed McBain, only the detectives cruise canals and not the mean streets of New York. This is an often slow-paced story, but the plot is plausible and well-conceived.

The very model of blond Aryan "purity," Irmgard sat on the Fï¿½hrer's knee for photographers, witnessed with excitement the comings and goings of all manner of famous personages, and with the blindness of a child accepted the Nazi doctrine that most of her family and everyone around her so eagerly embraced. Here, in a picture-postcard world untouched by the war and seemingly unblemished by the horrors Germany's master had wrought, she accepted the lies of her teachers and church and civic leaders, joined the Hitler Youth at age ten, and joyfully sang the songs extolling the virtues of National Socialism.</p><p>But before the end -- when she and other children would be forced to cower in terror in dank bomb shelters and wartime deprivations would take a harrowing toll -- Irmgard's doubts about the "truths" she had been force-fed increased, fueled by the few brave souls who had not accepted Hitler and his abominations. After the fall of the brutal dictatorship and the suicide of its mad architect, many of her neighbors and loved ones still clung to their beliefs, prejudices, denial, and unacknowledged guilt. Irmgard, often feeling lonely in her quest, was determined to face the truth of her country's criminal past and to bear the responsibility for an almost unbearable reality that most of her elders were determined to forget. She resolved even then that the lessons of her youth would guide her actions and steel her commitment to defend the freedoms and democratic values that had been so easily dismissed by the German people.</p><p>Provocative and astonishing, Irmgard A. Hunt's <strong>On Hitler's Mountain</strong> offers a unique, gripping, and vitally important first-person perspective on a tumultuous era in modern history, as viewed through the eyes of a child -- a candid and fascinating document, free of rationalization and whitewash, that chronicles the devastating moral collapse of a civilized nation.</p></p><p><p>Irmgard A. Hunt has been an executive at a number of environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Partnership for Central Europe, a project of the German Marshall Fund. After years as a consultant to several international not-for-profit organizations, she retired and began to write her memoirs. She holds a B.A. from Columbia University (which she earned at age fifty-two) and an M.P.A. from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She lives in Washington, D.C., and has two children and two grandchildren.</p>Hunt's moving, unsettling memoir is part of a literary and historical trend: examining the lives of ordinary Germans during WWII. She was born in 1934 in an intriguing locale&#x2014;Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, where Hitler set up his headquarters. In fact, in one of her most compelling stories, Hunt recalls sitting in Hitler's lap during a 1941 visit, "suspiciously studying his mustache, his slicked-back, oily hair... while at the same time acutely seeing the importance of the moment." In remarkable detail, she relates the normal parts of childhood (the birth of a sister, going to a new school) interspersed with the extraordinary events (e.g., Hunt's father was one of the first German soldiers killed during the war) of the time and place. The older members of her family and others in the village had vastly differing reactions to Hitler. The author (who now lives in Washington, D.C.) remembers how some teachers said, "Heil Hitler," while others preferred more traditional greetings. She also shows how Nazism pervaded day-to-day life. Although she portrays herself as uncomfortable with the regime, she pushed to join the Hitler Youth, only to leave it in the final months of the war. Those looking for an explanation of the Hitler phenomenon will be disappointed, but readers who want a richly textured memoir of a German girl during WWII will find it here.

And when she does, she&#x2019;s faced with something she&#x2019;s never seen before: a terrifyingly ordinary group of people&#x2014;kids, grandparents, soccer moms&#x2014;all recently turned and willing to die to avoid serving a master. And where there&#x2019;s one martyr, there will be more... <br><br>But even vampires have monsters that they&#x2019;re afraid of. And Anita is one of them...<p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>A conversation with Charlaine Harris, best-selling author of Deadlocked, and Laurell K. Hamilton, best-selling author of Kiss the Dead</strong><p></p> <p><strong>Question: Did you ever imagine that your series would run as long as it has?</strong></p> <p><strong>Charlaine Harris:</strong> I was just glad to sell the first book. It took two years of my agent sending it out to get a bite. I never even dreamed that Sookie would be so popular, that I would find so much to say about her and her world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Laurell K. Hamilton: </strong> No. I had over two hundred rejections for the first Anita Blake novel. They were the nicest rejections, with editors suggesting other publishing houses to send it to, but they, themselves, couldn't figure out how to market it. When I got that first three book contract, I remember thinking, "Well, at least I'll get to write three of them." I actually did think I had at least ten books in Anita and her world, but I don't think anyone can plan to write twenty-one novels in a series and still be excited about starting the twenty-second.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Did you ever dream paranormal would be this hot?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> I remember being told that mixed genre didn't sell, before the term paranormal became a genre. I was also told that no one wanted to read about vampires. More than one editor told me that particular monster was dead and gone. I thought there was life left in the old legends, but I never saw this level of popularity coming. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Yes, even my agent didn't expect <i>Dead Until Dark</i> would be an easy sell, maybe especially since my books contained a lot of humor. Vampires were passï¿½, and books that crossed genres (Except for yours: I think you had three or four books out when I wrote the first Sookie, and I was so glad to discover them!) were called "unshelvable.&#x2019; I could never have anticipated shelves and shelves of cross-genre books. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Does fan response play a part in your planning process?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> Not in the sense of changing plot direction in my novels. This is my story to tell, and I have to write it the way I see it. But every now and then when reader response to a character is unexpectedly enthusiastic--or the opposite--I'll take a second look at that character to see why he/she is coming across in a way I didn't expect or anticipate. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I don't change plot direction for fan reaction either. My story, my world, my books, my stuff, my way. The only people who can change the direction of my novels are my characters. It's their life, after all, so if they're really insistent on a different plot, then they win. I agree that reader response to a character can make me puzzle over them more, but it doesn't usually change how often the character is on stage, or how big their role is, because weirdly if the fans are interested, then I'm already intrigued. Best example is Edward who started out as this cold blooded assassin, almost a bad guy, and now he's one of Anita's best friends, and he's a U. S. Marshal. So, not what I had planned for him. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Have you ever had a character totally surprise you with their choices?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> A lot of my characters have minds of their own. Edward went away on his own and got himself engaged to a woman with two children from her first marriage. Edward-- assassin, ex-military, current police officer, taking a six-year-old to ballet lessons with all the other moms both amuses and hurts my head. Anita's love life went into a completely different direction than I'd ever anticipated. I so didn't see Anita dating this many men, or being in love with more than one man, and having everyone she loved okay with that. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> I've discovered some surprising things about my characters as I wrote them. I know that their minds are really my mind, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. It's like knowing a character has a secret (I'm thinking of Bill), and then suddenly realizing what that secret is. I was genuinely aghast. Sometimes my creative brain thinks a lot faster than my conscious brain. And it's certainly a lot more devious. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you keep a world with paranormal elements credible?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> I anchored my skewed world with real-life elements. Sookie has to pay her bills, she has to do her laundry, and she has family obligations. My vampires buy their clothes at the mall. My werewolf runs a surveying business. One of my fairies works in customer service at a department store. Readers seem to enjoy the fact that no matter what creature you may be, there's a process of surviving that has to be gone through; but there's all these other elements that make that process so different. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> I make sure any real life facts are as real and well-researched as possible. Because I'm asking people to believe in vampires, wereanimals, and zombies, I need to make sure the guns, cars, and real crime are as realistic as possible. Once a reader catches me wrong in an area where they are expert they won't believe my monsters are real. But I have found if I'm right on the hard facts even experts will let me fudge, or take that next fantastic leap, because I've proven myself by laying the foundation of reality to make my leap into the unknown. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Do people ever expect you to be your characters?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> If I had known people would get confused between fiction and fact I'd have made Anita look less like me, but it just never occurred to me that there would be a problem. I've had fans want to know what weapons I'm carrying. They assume all the men are based on real people, and they aren't. I don't actually base characters on real people. Since I can't lighten Anita's hair, I've lightened my own and I get less fan confusion. I've had fans ask for the phone numbers of the men and get angry when I tried to explain I couldn't give them the contact info for a fictional character. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH: </strong> Ha! Well, I'm much older and rounder than Sookie, so I'm definitely no stand-in for Sookie. In fact, readers who have never met me before are usually astonished when they meet me; so were the actors on <i>True Blood</i>. Some of my readers who came to me after watching <i>True Blood</i> get the characters in the books sort of conflated with the actors who play them on television. In their minds, Alexander Skarsgard IS Eric, Stephen Moyer IS Bill. It can lead to some confusing questions when I'm at signings. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What scenes in your novels are the most fun for you to write? Action? Sex? Relationship drama?</strong></p> <p><strong>CH: </strong> All of those are fun, depending on the outcome! But I have to say, I love to write a good fight scene. I find the "relationship" scenes a challenge. When people talk about their relationships, it's a messy conversation. People aren't too articulate about their innermost feelings. And such conversations don't proceed in a linear way, but jag back and forth as each speaker voices the issues that are most important to that person. So it's hard to make sound realistic, coherent, and yet condense such a conversation enough to make it tolerable. </p><p> </p><p><strong>LKH: </strong> It depends on my mood. Sometimes a good fight scene can be very therapeutic, and give a productive outlet for negative emotions. The more people involved in the action the more complex the fight choreography can become, and that can be a challenge, and slow down the emotional content for me. I enjoy doing sex scenes, but they are a different kind of challenge. On a day when I can get in the mood for the scene, they&#x2019;re great, but on a day when real life interferes, it&#x2019;s a bit like real sex. It&#x2019;s hard to concentrate on it when you have too many interruptions from the non-sexy side of your life. I guess that&#x2019;s true of all writing, though, too many interruptions disrupt the process in general. The biggest challenge for the sex scenes is that sex is a very personal and individual activity, so I have the same girl involved, but different men and I want each man&#x2019;s style to be unique. Relationship drama? Yuck, can I just say, yuck again? This kind of drama isn&#x2019;t fun in real life and the only thing that makes fictional relationship drama tolerable is that it&#x2019;s fictional, and I&#x2019;m not having to endure it in my real life, but other than that it sucks just as much. It also tends to complicate my life as a writer, because almost nothing screws up a story arc like relationship choices, though I have had action scenes go so differently from what I&#x2019;d planned that an entire third of a book had to be thrown out. It was a better book for it, but still, near deadline that was hard. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What&#x2019;s the hardest thing about writing such a long running series?</strong></p> <p><strong>LKH: </strong> The beginning of the book is easy, because you always want that to be interesting and lure in both old and new readers. It&#x2019;s the middle of the book that becomes more complicated. As a writer you always have to think that you may have brand new readers picking up your book, so you have to explain the characters, the world, everything, but you don&#x2019;t want to over explain to the long time readers. The other problem with a series is that each book needs to stand alone as much as possible, but you also want character growth and world development from novel to novel, so again, it&#x2019;s a balancing act. I make sure that each opening is different enough that you won&#x2019;t be left wondering, did I read that already. It&#x2019;s an issue I&#x2019;ve had with other series that I read. It gets very challenging when you get in double digits to make everything fresh, but familiar. I&#x2019;m lucky that I&#x2019;m still discovering new things about Anita, Jean-Claude, Edward, Nathaniel, everyone, and the world continues to grow and surprise me. My fictional world is like the real one, I never know quite what&#x2019;s coming next. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CH:</strong> The hardest thing is keeping track of previous developments and details. My memory just wasn't up to it, and I had to hire someone (the fabulous Victoria Koski). When you create a world, there are a thousand small things that make it credible, and it's easier than you'd think to forget whether someone is a werefox or a werelynx, or whether it's still daytime during the narrative or if you've passed into darkness. I think it's important to catch as many little errors as you can, so readers don't get yanked out of the world. I'm not the kind of reader who notices, but there are many readers who do.</p><p> </p><p>Photo Laurell K. Hamilton ï¿½ Stefan Hester</p> <p>Photo Charlaine Harris ï¿½ Sigrid Estrada</p>Laurell K.

Common names such as woodpecker and swallow are given even though several types of each species exist, but the general term is enough for the intended age level. An open format with limited text allows the large uncluttered illustrations to highlight the subjects. On most pages only one or two birds are discussed, and they are easily identified in the illustration. However, on a few pages several birds are seen, with little clue from the text as to which is which. The watercolor illustrations are rendered with realistic simplicity, so that line, form, and basic coloring are recognizable from a child's observations of birds in the wild. Lizzie Rockwell's pictures are more realistic than Ehlert's stylized illustrations in Feathers for Lunch (HBJ, 1990). Overall, this mother-daughter team has created an appealing book that will encourage identification of individual species and their behavior. --Diane Nunn, Richard E. Byrd Elem .

Chimpanzees join us at about 6 million years in the past, gorillas at 7 million years, orang utans at 14 million years, as we stride on together, a growing band. The journey provides the setting for a collection of some 40 tales. Each explores an aspect of evolutionary biology through the stories of characters met along the way or glimpsed from afar - the &#34;Elephant Bird&#39;s Tale&#34;, the &#34;Marsupial Mole&#39;s Tale&#34;, the &#34;Lungfish&#39;s Tale&#34;. Together they give a deep understanding of the processes that have shaped life on Earth: convergent evolution, the isolation of populations, continental drift, the great extinctions. The tales are interspersed with prologues detailing the journey, route maps showing joining lineages, and life-like reconstructions of our common ancestors. &#34;The Ancestor&#39;s Tale&#34; represents a pilgrimage on an unimaginable scale: our goal is four billion years away, and the number of pilgrims joining us grows vast - ultimately encompassing all living creatures. At the end of the journey lies something remarkable in its simplicity and transformative power: the first, humble, replicating molecules.</p><p>Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist renowned throughout the world.

In his six previous narratives of the American empire-Burr, Lincoln, 1876, Empire, Hollywood, and Washington, D.C.-he has created a fictional portrait of our nation from its founding that is unmatched in our literature for its scope, intimacy, political intelligence, and eloquence. Each has been a major bestseller, and some have stirred controversy for their decidedly ironic and unillusioned view of the realities of American power and of the men and women who have exercised that power.<br><br><b>The Golden Age</b> is Vidal's crowning achievement, a vibrant tapestry of American political and cultural life from 1939 to 1954, when the epochal events of World War Two and the Cold War transformed America, once and for all, for good or ill, from a republic into an empire. The sharp-eyed and sympathetic witnesses to these events are Caroline Sanford, Washington, D.C., newspaper publisher turned Hollywood pioneer producer-star, and Peter Sanford, her nephew and publisher of the independent intellectual journal The American Idea. They experience at first hand the masterful maneuvers of Franklin Roosevelt to bring a reluctant nation into World War Two, and later, the actions of Harry Truman that commit the nation to a decades-long twilight struggle against Communism-developments they regard with a marked skepticism, even though they end in an American global empire. The locus of these events is Washington, D.C., yet the Hollywood film industry and the cultural centers of New York also play significant parts. In addition to presidents, the actual characters who appear so vividly in the pages of <b>The Golden Age</b> include Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Wendell Willkie, William Randolph Hearst, Dean Acheson, Tennessee Williams, Joseph Alsop, Dawn Powell-and Gore Vidal himself.<br><br><b>The Golden Age</b> offers up United States history as only Gore Vidal can, with unrivaled penetration, wit, and high drama, allied to a classical view of human fate. It is a supreme entertainment that will also change readers' understanding of American history and power.</p><p>Since 1967, when he published <i>Washington, D.C.</i>, Gore Vidal has been assembling an artful, acidic history of the United States. <i>The Golden Age</i> represents the seventh and final installment of this national epic, covering the years from 1939 to 1954 (with a valedictory fast-forward, in its final pages, to the end of the millennium). As Vidal did in the earlier books, the author sticks pretty rigorously to the facts. Real-life figures--in this case, the likes of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry Truman and that ardent cold warrior Dean Acheson--do what they are recorded to have done. The author also ushers on a cast of invented characters, who are free to paddle in the historical backwash and comment upon their so-called contemporaries. It's here, of course, that fact and fiction begin to blur. But Vidal himself has often cited Tolstoy's famous jab--"History would be an excellent thing if it only were true"--and his reconstruction of FDR's wartime machinations, and the brief interval of Pax Americana, seem persuasively, even alarmingly plausible.<p> There's one key difference between this book and its predecessors, however. Vidal was alive and kicking in 1939, and thanks to his role as Senator Thomas Pryor Gore's grandson (and occasional seeing-eye dog), he met or at least observed many of <i>The Golden Age</i>'s dramatis personae. This fact turns out to have a double edge. On one hand, it gives his portraits of the high and mighty an extra ounce of verisimilitude. Here (the invented) Caroline Sanford observes her old friend FDR at an informal White House mixer: </p><blockquote> She felt for an instant that she should curtsey in the awesome presence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a figure who towered even when seated in his wheelchair. It was the head and neck that did the trick, she decided, with a professional actor's eye. The neck was especially thick while the famous head seemed half again larger than average, its thinning gray hair combed severely back from a high rounded forehead. </blockquote> Like all of Vidal's politicians, FDR is a more or less gifted illusionist, and <i>The Golden Age</i> is one more chapter in the convergence of theater and politics, of Hollywood and Washington, D.C. But the very vividness of these historical actors (in every sense of the phrase) makes the author's invented cast seem a little pale and lifeless. No matter. Even in its occasional longueurs, Vidal's concluding volume is packed with ironic insight and world-class gossip, much of it undoubtedly true. And in the surprisingly metafictional finale, he signs off with a fine display of Heraclitean fireworks, not to mention an encore appearance from his rakish progenitor Aaron Burr--which makes you wonder exactly who created whom. <i>--James Marcus</i>Praise for Gore Vidal and His Narratives of the American Empire: "Vidal has no peers at breathing movement and laughter into the historical past."<br>-<i>Time</i><br><br>"If Gore Vidal were not such a brilliantly witty and ruthlessly irreverent novelist, we would be more ready to recognize him as the fine historian he is. Nowhere among his impressive historical novels does he bring together these talents with more penetrating bravado than in this gripping and illuminating dissection of the American empire at high tide."<br>-Ronald Steel<br><br>"Vidal writes so well that you find yourself holding your breath over something that is a foregone conclusion...Vidal's talent makes the bloated corrupters of Washington live in a way that history books don't."<p>-<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>"It is probably impossible to be an American and not be impressed by Vidal's telescoping of our early history."</p><p>-<i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"Vidal is a masterly American historical novelist...Vidal's imagination of American politics, then and now, is so powerful as to compel awe."<br>-Harold Bloom, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"No living American surpasses Gore Vidal in the difficult art of the historical novel...He has re-created American history...with an immediacy, color and detail that [are] denied the historian."<br>-Michael Beschloss, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"Mr. Vidal demonstrates a political imagination and insider's sagacity equaled by no other practicing fiction writer I can think of."<br>-<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Our greatest living historical novelist."<br>-Anthony Burgess<br><br>"[Vidal] deals with issues that most other novelists (and historians) are reluctant to confront...talks straight about important matters, so it is perhaps true that we have to come to terms with Vidal if we are to do justice to ourselves. That is the power of the man. As with all the great ones. He has always annoyed us because he will not allow us to evade the issues."</p><p><br>-William Appleman Williams, <b>In These Times</b><br></p></p><h2>The Cruiser: A Dan Lenson Novel (Dan Lenson Novels)</h2><p><p>Newly-promoted to Captain, Dan Lenson's first glimpse of his command is of a ship literally high and dry.

As the wing of the vice CNO&#x2019;s private jet lifted, she bent over him to point outside, giving a flash of cleavage at the neckline of her flight suit. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Vesuvius, sir. Harbor&#x2019;s coming up on your right.&#x201d;</p> <p>The immense double mounds of the volcano barricaded the sky. Below stretched miles of roofs, streets, apartments, their windows flashing flame-orange in the winter sun. The air was hazy with mist, or maybe smoke. What must it be like, living in the shadow of a volcano? The very volcano&#x2014;if he remembered correctly&#x2014;where Hephaestus had forged the weapons of Mars, the god of war.</p> <p>Then a great glittering rose-silver arc rolled up into view, and Dan leaned into the seat belt, shading his eyes. The pilot kept the wing depressed, as if to give his only passenger the opportunity for a long look down.</p> <p>Captain Daniel Valentine Lenson, U.S. Navy, traced the tracks and roads that edged the sweeping concavity of sea that was the Bay of Naples; the inner harbor; the stone moles, spidery thin and knobbed as a movie alien&#x2019;s fingers. Cruise ships lay alongside the Mussolini-era passenger terminal, deck on deck shining in the sun like white steel wedding cakes.</p> <p>A cliff of masonry, the fortification that had guarded the city in days past, frowned half a mile south of the inner harbor. Two hundred yards short of it lay the gray wedge of a Ticonderoga-class cruiser. A tug was nudging a barge alongside; smaller craft sketched foamy orbits around it. Those would be force protection, small boats guarding the helpless giant.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can you see it?&#x201d; The copilot, leaning even farther over him. Blond hair swung forward, wafting a perfume he hadn&#x2019;t caught before. &#x201c;We can notify Traffic Control and circle. Get you a better look.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d; One glimpse had seared it into his retinas. The orange of spill-containment booms. The blues and greens that paled abruptly to shoal water a third of the way back from the stem. USS <i>Savo Island</i> was hard aground. That much was clear, even from five thousand feet.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be wheels down in ten, then. Is your seat belt secure? Just let me check&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll snug it up, thanks.&#x201d; Dan scratched his chin. He wore two rings: the heavy gold Annapolis one, and the thinner, traditional Navy wedding band, with stars and anchors. Glancing at his hand, she opened her mouth, as if about to say something. Then seemed to think better of it, and headed back to the cockpit. Still, he could appreciate the curve of her receding ass, firmly outlined by the tight-fitting flight suit.</p> <p>The turbines whined up, then down, and dust floated and sparkled in the sunlight slanting through the window. No wonder Admiral Barry &#x201c;Nick&#x201d; Niles had diverted his personal aircraft to get a newly promoted surface line captain here as quickly as possible. An Aegis cruiser. The envy of other navies worldwide. Yet now she lay helpless on a shoal everyone knew was there, that was plainly shown on charts and even marked with a warning buoy.</p> <p>How could it have happened?</p> <p>And what was he going to do about it?</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>HE descended the deplaning ladder feeling like a member of Congress, carrying his briefcase and with his notebook computer slung over the other shoulder. Into hot exhaust and chilly, smoke-smelling wind. Down the line, airliners nuzzled a glass-walled commercial terminal. The U.S. Naval Support Activity, Capodichino, shared the runway with Naples International Airport.</p> <p>A tall, eager lieutenant in khakis. &#x201c;Captain Lenson? Lieutenant Mills.&#x2026; Matt. It&#x2019;s a real honor.&#x201d;</p> <p>He returned the salute awkwardly, and the junior officer relieved him of the computer. &#x201c;I need to see Commodore Roald as soon as possible,&#x201d; Dan told him.</p> <p>Mills glanced up from Dan&#x2019;s ribbons. He swallowed, looking intimidated.</p> <p>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t make me any different from anyone else, Lieutenant. The commodore?&#x201d;</p> <p>A fresh blast of exhaust swept over them. Turning away, Mills yelled, &#x201c;Right, sir. She, uh, told me she didn&#x2019;t need you until tomorrow, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My orders were to report to her.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a legal issue, sir. She can&#x2019;t meet with the relieving commanding officer until the decision&#x2019;s made that the outgoing CO is actually outgoing. As I understand it.&#x201d;</p> <p>That made sense. Niles had insisted that he see Roald the instant he arrived. But Nick Niles wasn&#x2019;t here. Mills was ushering him into a small room with a plush brown suede sofa, a low table, and a modernistic, chromed Italian coffeemaker. &#x201c;This is our distinguished-visitor lounge, sir. The head&#x2019;s through there. We&#x2019;ll get your luggage and bring your sedan around.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I may not need a car. Where&#x2019;s the court being held?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Court of inquiry&#x2019;s in Admin Two. That&#x2019;s further down the Spina. Or I can just take you to your quarters.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dan sank into the sofa. &#x201c;So. Matt, is it? What do you do for Commodore Roald?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m the Aegis go-to guy on the DesRon staff. Did my previous tour on <i>Anzio</i>. Why she sent me to meet you, I think.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can you give me any background? I know the investigation&#x2019;s still in progress.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Mills closed a door Dan assumed led to the main passenger area. &#x201c;I can tell you what I heard from the Port Ops guys. But I can&#x2019;t vouch it&#x2019;s true.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Always good to hear the scuttlebutt.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yessir. Long&#x2019;s you know I&#x2019;m not exactly the burning bush&nbsp;&#x2026; <i>Savo</i> went aground day before yesterday. Coming in early, in the rain, bound for anchorage A4. What I heard, the quartermaster chief noticed they were coming in off bearings. The navigator told the conning officer she was coming in too fast and to change course. She&#x2014;the conning officer&#x2014;she thought she was right, and the CO backed her. The navigator tried to relieve her, and the skipper told him to, quote, &#x2018;shut the fuck up,&#x2019; unquote. Then ordered him off the bridge.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mills glanced at the door. &#x201c;At that point&#x2014;and again, this is secondhand&#x2014;kind of an argument-slash-clusterfuck broke out. Suddenly the castle looms out of the rain. The bo&#x2019;s&#x2019;un sounds the collision alarm. The captain takes the conn, but they lose steering or maybe engine control, and when he orders the anchor dropped, the deck gang can&#x2019;t get the brake released in time.&#x201d;</p> <p>A shiver harrowed Dan&#x2019;s back. A concatenation of errors and failures leading to disaster. &#x201c;How fast did they hit?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fifteen, sixteen knots.&#x201d;</p> <p>He winced. &#x201c;How bad&#x2019;s the damage?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re still looking at it. A team from Surflant&#x2019;s down there. And, um, a lot of Italians.&#x201d; The aide&#x2019;s cell went off. &#x201c;Excuse me, sir.&#x2026; Yeah&nbsp;&#x2026; yeah, he&#x2019;s here, in the DV lounge.&#x2026; Yes ma&#x2019;am. I&#x2019;ll tell him.&#x201d; He snicked it closed. &#x201c;She says you might want to go down and take a look. I can drive you, if you want.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dan wavered, torn between waiting for Roald and wanting to see the ship that very soon might be his own. Then took a deep breath, and nodded.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>FIVE or six demonstrators pumped placards as Mills flashed his ID at a police barrier between crumbling ancient bastions. Some of the signs were in Italian; others, English. One read NO TO SHOCK AND AWE. They were waved through, though a car that tried to follow them in was surrounded by the shouting crowd. They rumbled over a concrete causeway, past a marina. A tunnel yawned in a looming pile of decaying volcanic stone. &#x201c;The Castel dell&#x2019;Ovo,&#x201d; Mills said. Dan assumed they were headed for the tunnel, but instead the road zagged and they skirted the massive sloped buttresses until the Mediterranean, blue and soft as a newborn&#x2019;s eyes, opened ahead.</p> <p>Police and fire vehicles were jammed bumper to bumper. They had to pass three separate cordons. The first two were Italian; city police, then the federal carabinieri. The last was U.S. Navy, in helmets and black Kevlar and shorty carbines with black web slings. Guards examined their IDs, listened to Mills&#x2019;s explanation of who Dan was, and directed them to where they could look out over a final barrier of tumbled riprap crusted with barnacles and drifted plastic bottles and lost beach sandals.</p> <p>The exposed mud smelled like a sewage treatment plant, but probably wasn&#x2019;t as ripe as it would get in summer. The cruiser lay motionless. Heat shimmered above the stumpy aux exhaust riser aft, but as far as he could tell, the main turbines weren&#x2019;t lit off. The sheer of the hull, the towering bluff of the superstructure, echoed the ramparts inland, though its horizon-blending haze gray was lighter than the ash-gray volcanic tuff of the medieval fortification. Tugs lay alongside, and the barge he&#x2019;d noted from the air had been joined by another. Dan guessed they were taking off fuel, water, and lube oil, starting the laborious process of lightening ship. A third barge with a crane hovered some distance off.</p> <p>A chief in tac gear saluted. He was in charge of force protection; could he be of any help? Dan nodded toward the ship. &#x201c;I may be relieving her skipper. Depending on the investigation. What d&#x2019;ya know about how she went aground?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not much, sir. My team&#x2019;s out of Civitavecchia. We&#x2019;re just helping the locals maintain the perimeter.&#x201d; He glanced seaward. &#x201c;I got tac comms with our RHIB, though. Want to take a look?&#x201d;</p> <p>Dan considered. &#x201c;Can I borrow a helmet?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Certainly, sir. Spare in the boat.&#x201d; He spoke into a Motorola, and one of the circling inflatables broke from orbit and turned a blunt nose for them.</p> <p>They boarded from a floating pier at the boat basin. Not far away several yacht owners were talking rapidly in Italian, gesticulating contemptuously toward the grounded warship. Dan settled Kevlar on his head as the rigid inflatable purred back out into the smoky wind, the light chop.</p> <p>The cruiser grew as they neared. It towered vertical, clifflike, unclimbable, with a lack of motion that struck a sailor as unnatural, although the steady roar of blowers and machinery, the mingled smells of exhaust and fuel and cooked food, were familiar. The overlofty, topheavy-looking superstructure was canted slightly to starboard. Aluminum, Dan remembered, and the whole class had been reporting cracks. A seaman in dark blue coveralls watched from the boat deck. Dan noted the colors had been shifted aft.</p> <p>His gaze rose. Aloft, flags fluttered, the surface search radar rotated. Flat squarish panels with truncated corners, not quite octagons, were set like badges on the superstructure. They were the ship&#x2019;s reason for being; in many ways, her main batteries, though ranks of missiles were hidden beneath hinged flush covers fore and aft.</p> <p>Those bland panels were SPY-1 antenna arrays. The Ticonderogas had been designed around them, mating a Spruance-class hull and propulsion to the most powerful radars ever put to sea. Within a radius of three hundred miles, an Aegis cruiser could detect, track, identify, and reach out with missiles to destroy any aircraft threatening the massive carriers that centerpieced U.S. or NATO battle groups.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, Lenson,&#x201d; Nick Niles had rumbled four days before, slapping his desk, &#x201c;I keep my promises. Still want a ship?&#x201d;</p> <p>Dan had stood by the window of the vice CNO&#x2019;s temporary office at the Buchanan House, looking out toward the Pentagon. The offices he and Niles had staggered out of together, through burning fuel, under collapsing ceilings, over torn-apart bodies, were being gutted and rebuilt.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes sir,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d murmured. Niles had stalled his career, blocked his promotion, spread the word that the most highly decorated officer in the sea services was a hothead, an individualist, reckless, cavalier, unaccountable. He seemed to have changed his mind after 9/11. Somehow he&#x2019;d engineered Dan&#x2019;s fourth stripe, though his fingerprints were nowhere to be seen. But Dan was still wary of African-American admirals bearing gifts.</p> <p>&#x201c;You made captain. Sure you don&#x2019;t want to cash in your chips? Take a medical retirement on those wheezy lungs, go make some real money?&#x201d;</p> <p>He didn&#x2019;t answer, and a hollow boom quivered the air as a big palm walloped the desk again. &#x201c;Okay. A command? I got one. You might actually be a good fit. Your background with missiles. Think about who you can cherry-pick from TAG to take with you. Fill in the holes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you won&#x2019;t have long.&#x201d; A sausagelike finger had boresighted him. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for results. She&#x2019;s out there on a national-level mission. If this ship doesn&#x2019;t turn around, and I mean on a dime, I&#x2019;ve got another O-6 with his bags packed. And tread light this time, Lenson. No more <i>Gaddis</i>es. No more <i>Horn</i>s.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the mission, sir?&#x201d; Dan had asked.</p> <p>And Niles had told him.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can look at the far side, sir,&#x201d; said the coxswain, beside him in the boat. Dan nodded. Binoculars flashed from the bridge wing; he turned his collars up to hide his rank insignia. On the port side the red antifouling coating rose several feet above the waterline. &#x201c;The screws seem to be in deeper water,&#x201d; Mills yelled, and Dan nodded again. That&#x2019;d be a plus, if the shafts and screws weren&#x2019;t damaged. He could borrow fins and take a look, if that wasn&#x2019;t beneath the dignity of a skipper. Still, the sonar dome, all the way forward, looked as if it had been driven right up onto the shoal.</p> <p>He took one more long survey, stem to stern, all 570 gray humming, roaring feet of her; at men and women standing about on the fantail, gazing longingly at the city that stretched away into the hazy distance, climbing the slopes of silent ominous peaks. Then said to the coxswain, &#x201c;Thanks for the look. You can put us ashore now.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>DRIVING back to the base, Dan remembered coming here as a lieutenant (jg), aboard USS <i>Guam.</i> Naples had been a grim, depressed city of blowing trash and sullen crowds and wash hanging from shabby tenements, with too many people and far too little employment. In those days every bullet-chipped wall had been plastered with Communist posters, and sailors on liberty had been warned to travel in groups.</p> <p>There was still trash back in the alleys, and the streets were no wider, but the Terminale Marittima had been freshly repainted and the cars they idled behind were new. The shops were all open, with bright signs and fully stocked windows. The women who crossed in total disregard of whether or not the lights said to walk swung along jauntily in glossy leather boots and stylish coats, and the men looked far more hopeful. Italy seemed to be doing well, even in what had always been one of its least-advantaged cities. Maybe the protection of the U.S. Navy had helped it get there. He liked to think so, anyway.</p> <p>Mills was slowing the sedan at the entrance to the base when Dan noticed another crowd. The guardhouse lay at the end of a cul-de-sac walled off from the main terminal by blocks of warehouses and trucking garages and the concertina wire surrounding the Alitalia repair shops. A line of cars waited to enter, but between them and the guard shack a chain of demonstrators were waving signs, gesticulating, and marching back and forth. Their shouts echoed down the cul-de-sac, amplified by the concrete walls.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on up there, Matt?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. Work disagreement, I think. There&#x2019;s always a strike someplace in town.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That hasn&#x2019;t changed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Usually it&#x2019;s pretty tame. They even announce the time it&#x2019;ll be over, when they strike the train lines. So everybody can plan. It&#x2019;s pretty civilized.&#x201d; Mills touched the pedal and the sedan edged up. He slid out a sign that read AUTOVETTUR...</p></p><h2>A Glassblower's Companion: A Compilation of Studio Equipment Designs, Essays, &amp; Glassblowing Ideas</h2><p>A Glassblower's Companion is a book about Giberson's views on glass technology. It is a collection of designs, essays, and glassmaking ideas which focus on the underlying philosophy of hot glass. It is a document that will be of interest to anyone who works with glass, whether he/she is a glassblower, a pate de verre caster, or a modern beadmaker, even someone who simply collects and loves glass. Archaeologists will be especially interested in the ancient glass explanations, as Giberson focuses on simple ideas that actually work.<br><br>On a very practical side, this book is about building and maintaining studio equipment. It has twenty-five chapters: five are on glory holes (from a small 6 inch paperweight maker's glory to a huge 4 burner unit with a 30 inch opening); ten chapters are about furnaces for melting glass, again from small to big; five chapters are on annealers and slumpers, kilns for casting as well; and finally there are five chapters on accessory glass making equipment. The purpose of the book is to allow the reader to acquire enough insight and knowledge while reading this document that he should be able to build his own studio equipment when finished.</p><p>Dudley Giberson is a glassmaker from Warner, NH, who has had an active studio since 1968. Dudley developed his expertise primarily working alone (but was influenced by other early GAS members), Early on he learned the skills of glass blowing, pate de verre casting and murrine work. He spent a good number of years working on large copper foil stained glass windows and another 25 years developing and designing beads of all kinds and selling a line of intricate bead necklaces. In the early years he developed a special burner for furnaces and glory holes, the Giberson Ceramic Burner Head, which he patented (U.S. Pat. #3697000). Dudley is currently working on ancient glass puzzles, that is, how specific pieces of ancient glass were made. Dudley is still producing burners and elements for his studio equipment business.</p><h2>Universal Method for Saxophone</h2><p>One of the best known of all instrumental methods Paul de Ville&#39;s Universal Method For Saxaphone has been the basic training method for countless generations of Saxaphone players covering all the basic pedagogical requirements for teaching Saxaphone. Universal Method deals with tone production, reeds, the use of the mouth piece, tuning, basic musical terms and all the other essential of mastering the Saxaphone.</p><p>Rich with surprise and hilarious adventure, <i>The Prince And The Pauper</i> is a delight satire of England's romantic past and a joyful boyhood romp filled with the same tongue-in-cheek irony that sparked the best of Mark Twain's tall tales. Two boys, one an urchin from London's filthy lanes, the other a prince born in a lavish palace, unwittingly trade identities. Thus a bedraggled "Prince of Poverty" discovers that his private dreams have all the come true -- while a pampered Prince of Wales finds himself tossed into a rough-and-tumble world of squalid beggars and villainous thieves. Originally written as a story for children, <i>The Prince And The Pauper</i> is a classic novel for adults as well -- through its stinging attack on the ageless human folly of attempting to measure true worth by outer appearances.This treasured historical satire, played out in two very different socioeconomic worlds of 16th-century England, centers around the lives of two boys born in London on the same day: Edward, Prince of Wales, and Tom Canty, a street beggar. During a chance encounter, the two realize they are identical and, as a lark, decide to exchange clothes and roles&#x2014;a situation that briefly, but drastically, alters the lives of both youngsters. <br>The Prince, dressed in rags, wanders about the city's boisterous neighborhoods among the lower classes and endures a series of hardships; poor Tom, now living with the royals, is constantly filled with the dread of being discovered for who and what he really is. <br>Brimming with gentle humor and discerning social scrutiny, this timeless tale of transposed identities remains one of Twain's most popular and best-loved novels.</p><h2>Women of Faith Study Guide Series: Encouraging One Another</h2><p>Hardcover and spiral bound</p><p></p><h2>The Story of English in 100 Words</h2><p><p>The world's foremost expert on the English language takes us on an entertaining and eye-opening tour of the history of our vernacular through the ages.</p><p>In <i>The Story of English in 100 Words</i>, an entertaining history of the world's most ubiquitous language, David Crystal draws on one hundred words that best illustrate the huge variety of sources, influences and events that have helped to shape our vernacular since the first definitively English word&#x2015;&#x2018;roe'&#x2015;was written down on the femur of a roe deer in the fifth century.

During the war he subjected some 3000 twins, mostly young, to experiments of unspeakable horror. Only 160 of them were alive when the Russians liberated Auschwitz in 1945. The authors have interviewed several of the surviving twins and here present their stories, including details of their postwar lives. One especially disturbing aspect of the book is the fact that some of the victims remember Mengele as a charming father-substitute in whom they yearned to place their trust. There are glimpses of Mengele joking with the children, taking them on outings, hugging them. One survivor insists he was gentle; another flatly states that he "loved little children." Woven skillfully into the narrative is a formal and engrossing biography of Mengele himself, his family background, his wartime career, his escape to South America, his years in hiding. None of the surviving twins believes that the remains found in Brazil in 1985 are those of the death-camp doctor; according to the authors, they are certain that Mengele has succeeded in "tricking the world yet another time." An important addition to the literature of the Holocaust. Lagnado is a freelance writer, Dekel is the widow of an Auschwitz twin.

Most Cherokees were forcibly relocated to eastern Oklahoma in the early nineteenth century. In 1830 the U.S. government shifted its policy from one of trying to assimilate American Indians to one of relocating them and proceeded to drive seventeen thousand Cherokee people west of the Mississippi. <br><br> <i>The Cherokee Nation and the Trail of Tears</i> recounts this moment in American history and considers its impact on the Cherokee, on U.S.-Indian relations, and on contemporary society. Guggenheim Fellowship-winning historian Theda Perdue and coauthor Michael D. Green explain the various and sometimes competing interests that resulted in the Cherokee?s expulsion, follow the exiles along the Trail of Tears, and chronicle their difficult years in the West after removal.</p><p><b>Theda Perdue, Ph.D.</b> is a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and recent winner of a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Green, Ph.D.</b> is a professor of history and American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of <i>The Politics of Indian Removal</i>.This compact book by eminent historians Perdue and Green moves from the time when all Cherokees lived in the southern Appalachians to their forced expulsion to the Indian Territory, as American policy morphed from civilizing Native Americans to what might today be deemed ethnic cleansing. The Indian Removal Act (1830) fixed in law a revolutionary program of political and social engineering that caused unimaginable suffering, deaths in the thousands, and emotional pain that lingers to this day. It's a tangled tale of partisan politics and Cherokee power struggles, of juridical argument and economic motive, of bitter personal disputes and changing public policy. Perdue (<i>Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southeast</i>) and Green (<i>The Cherokee Removal</i>) have written a lucid, readable account of the legal complexities of the 18th-century right of conquest doctrine and the 19th-century emerging doctrine of state rights; the treaties, alliances, obligations and assurances involved; and the landmark cases <i>Cherokee</i> v. <i>Georgia</i> and <i>Worcester </i>v. <i>Georgia</i> (one effectively denying Cherokee self-government, one ineffectively affirming Cherokee sovereignty). Over it all hangs the disquieting knowledge that in the history of interaction between Euro-Americans and Indians, Cherokee removal [exemplifies] a larger history that no one should forget. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A simple assignment quickly turns into a kidnapping, as Chin and Smith make their way through the complex world of triad politics, Asian intrigue, and the smuggling of Chinese antiquities.

By the author of Cinderella Man. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Jeremy Schaap is the author of the New York Times bestseller Cinderella Man. An ESPN anchor and national correspondent, his work has been published in Sports Illustrated, ESPN the Magazine, Time, Parade, TV Guide, and the New York Times. He has also appeared on ABC&#39;s World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News. He is the son of the award-winning journalist Dick Schaap.Prologue Just before 9:30 p.m. central time on September 23, 1955, in a handsome townhouse on Chicago&#x2019;s South Side, James Cleveland Owens slipped into a tweed jacket and sat down in a straight-backed chair. As he smoothed out his pencil mustache and slicked back his hair what little was left of it a dozen technicians put the finishing touches on what had been an allday job, wiring and lighting the Owens home. In a few minutes, Owens would be talking live on national television with Edward R. Murrow of CBS, on his celebrity interview show Person to Person. More than 20 million Americans would watch as Murrow spoke from a studio in New York via satellite, first with Owens and his family, and then, in the second half of the show, with Leonard Bernstein and his.<br> A forty-two-year-old father of three, Jesse Owens weighed twenty- five pounds more than he had in Berlin in 1936, when he had turned in the most indelible performance ever at the Olympic games. In his conservative jacket, flannel slacks, white shirt, and dark tie, he could have passed for a fifty-year-old. Not that he wasn&#x2019;t in superb shape. He was. In fact, just a few months earlier he had run 100 yards in 9.9 seconds, less than a second slower than his personal best. He still held the world record in both the broad jump (now called the long jump) and the 4 x 100-meter relay though both records had been set in the mid-1930s.<br> For his part, Murrow was readying himself for another half-hour of banalities. No one confused Person to Person with See It Now, Murrow&#x2019;s other show on CBS, the one on which eighteen months earlier he had neutered Senator Joseph McCarthy. Despite the fluff, Murrow was eager to speak with Owens, whose legend had grown significantly since 1936. Here, Murrow thought, was a legitimate American hero, the man who had humbled the Third Reich. For Owens, the appearance with Murrow was emblematic of his enhanced stature. In the first fifteen years after his athletic career ended, he had struggled to find his way, professionally and financially. He made more money than the vast majority of his fellow Americans in the dry-cleaning business, at Ford Motors, working for the state of Illinois but the windfall he expected in the aftermath of his Olympic heroics never materialized. Banned from amateur competition after an imbroglio with American track officials, he had raced against horses most famously in Havana, in December 1936, defeating Julio McCaw, a five-year-old bay gelding, after the horse spotted him a 40-yard advantage. In 1938, on the occasion of the first night baseball game at Ebbets Field, he raced two speedy major-league outfielders, spotting them several yards. He barnstormed with a black baseball team and campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon. In countless ways, he sold himself but he never had much to show for it. Until now.<br> By the time Owens sat down to speak with Murrow, he was well on his way to becoming an institution the Jesse Owens who would spend the rest of his life telling his story to appreciative audiences around the world, the Jesse Owens who could have been a hero from Horatio Alger, if Alger&#x2019;s heroes had not all been white. In the years after his Olympic victories, his achievements in Berlin had been overshadowed by World War II. But by 1955, at the end of the first decade of the cold war, he was finally getting his due. He was in demand as a banquet speaker and making good money because he had become useful to industry and government as a symbol of the opportunities America promised and sometimes delivered. To the delight of white America and most of black America, he disputed the sentiments of Paul Robeson, the All-American football player turned actor/ singer, who famously suggested that African-Americans would not and should not fight for the United States in the event of war with the Soviet Union. Owens, in contrast, held himself out as an example of what black Americans could achieve, despite the indignities and slights he had suffered his entire life. He agreed with Jackie Robinson, who in his 1949 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee had said that blacks had too much invested in the American experiment to support its enemies.<br> Just a few days after his appearance on Person to Person, Owens was to embark, at the behest of the State Department, on a goodwill tour of Singapore, Malaya, the Philippines, and India. As A. M. Rosenthal, then the New York Times correspondent in South Asia, put it, Owens&#x2019;s mission was to make friends for the United States.&#x201d; Having fought the fascists with his fleetness of foot, he would now fight the Communists with his charm and rhetoric even thhough some Indian writers, unversed in the annals of the Olympics, confused him with Sir Owen Dixon, an Australian judge and United NNNNNations mediator.<br> Before the long ride to the subcontinent, though, there was the interview with Murrow, whose fondness for bespoke tailoring matched his own. Finally, at 9:30, with a cigarette clenched in his left hand, Murrow began the interview.<br> Jesse Owens,&#x201d; he said, is generally recognized as the greatest track star of the last half-century. His performance in Berlin stands unmatched in modern times. Statistics will never indicate Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s reaction as he watched a twenty-three-year-old boy from Danville, Alabama, run the athletes of the master race right into the ground.&#x201d; Owens, whose politeness was among his defining characteristics, declined to correct Murrow by pointing out that he had been twenty-two, not twenty-three, and was from Oakville, Alabama, not Danville. He simply smiled and waited for the questions he knew were coming, the questions that always came.<br> After several minutes of amiable chatter You look to be in almost good enough condition to get out your old track shoes again&#x201d; and the introduction of Owens&#x2019;s wife and three pretty daughters, Murrow offered him the opportunity to talk about the games of the Eleventh Olympiad. Jesse Owens,&#x201d; he said, what&#x2019;s your warmest memory of that August of 1936?&#x201d; Owens had been asked this question, or its variants, perhaps hundreds of times. He did not hesitate. I remember a boy,&#x201d; he said, his accent betraying no hint of his southern roots, that I competed against in the broad jump a boy with whom I built a friendship and we corresponded for a number of years, and then the war broke out, and I didn&#x2019;t hear any more from him at all.&#x201d; Owens looked down and away from the camera. The boy he was referring to was Luz Long, the silver medalist, a pureblooded Aryan from Leipzig who had helped him reach the broad-jump finals when he had been on the verge of disqualifying. Composing himself, Owens talked about Long&#x2019;s son Kai Owens and Kai had met in 1951 and then about winning the 100-meter dash. But he had not yet answered Murrow&#x2019;s question.<br> I think that the greatest moment that a person can have is to stand on a victory stand,&#x201d; he said, far away from home, and then, from the distance you can hear the strains of The Star- Spangled Banner,&#x2019; and then suddenly you make a left turn and you see the Stars and Stripes rising higher and higher, and the higher the Stars and Stripes rose the louder the strains of the Star-Spangled Banner would be heard. I think that&#x2019;s the greatest moment of my whole athletic career.&#x201d; Finished, he smiled, looking slightly off-camera.<br> Thank you very much, Jesse Owens,&#x201d; Murrow said, taking a deep drag. In just a moment, we&#x2019;ll take you for a visit with Leonard Bernstein and his wife, Felicia Montealegre.&#x201d; Now Owens rose from his chair and dug into his pants pockets. Unlike Murrow, he had not dared to smoke on camera. Acutely conscious of his image, it simply would not do for Jesse Owens, the great track champion, to be seen smoking on network television. Nor did he want any of the young people who idolized him to think that he condoned the use of tobacco. But now that the technicians were coiling their cables and packing their cases, he pulled out a cigarette, lit up, and inhaled. Eventually, this habit would kill him as it killed Murrow. But he was hooked, of course, and he would just as soon have joined the Communist Party as quit his Camels.<br> As the crew finally moved his couch and coffee table back where they belonged into the deep indentations in the carpet Owens and his wife, Ruth, carefully returned his memorabilia to a display case. A few special items had been freed from the case temporarily, for Murrow and his audience to see clearly. There were the bronzed spikes. And the medals. The laurel wreaths. All the tokens of his youthful greatness. He had collected them nineteen years earlier, in Germany, with the eyes of the world fixed on him, in an atmosphere charged by an ascendant Third Reich, on a continent that would soon convulse in war and genocide.<br> Nothing Jesse Owens did at the Olympic stadium diminished the horrors to come. He saved no lives. However, for those paying close enough attention, Owens, in Berlin, revealed essential truths. While the western democracies were perfecting the art of appeasement, while much of the rest of the world kowtowed to the Nazis, Owens stood up to them at their own Olympics, refuting their venomous theories with his awesome deeds.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2007 by Jeremy Schaap.

Maybe that's why no one argued when the sentence came down: The Fauborg had to die. I live in a company town where the product is illusion. In the alternate universe ruled by sociopaths who make movies, communication means snappy dialogue, the scalpel trumps genetics, and permanence is mortal sin because it slows down the shoot. L.A. used to have more Victorian mansions than San Francisco but L.A. called in the wrecking ball and all that handwork gave way to thirties bungalows that yielded to fifties dingbats, which were vanquished, in turn, by big-box adult dormitories with walls a toddler can put a fist through. Preservationists try to stem the erosion but end up fighting for the likes of gas stations and ticky-tack motels. Money changes hands, zoning laws are finessed, and masterpieces like the Ambassador Hotel dissolve like wrinkles shot with Botox. The Fauborg Hotel was no Ambassador but it did have its charm. Four somber stories of Colonial brick-face, it sat on a quiet block of Crescent Drive in Beverly Hills, wedged between a retirement home and a dry cleaner. A short walk but a psychic universe from the Eurotrash cafï¿½s of Canon Drive and the shopping frenzy on Beverly and Rodeo, the Fauborg appeared in few guidebooks but managed to boast one of the highest occupancy rates in the city. Built in 1949 by a French Holocaust survivor, its design aped the mansions in the American movies that had transfixed Marcel Jabotinsky as a teenager. Jabotinksy's first guests were other postwar ï¿½migrï¿½s seeking peace and quiet. That same desire for low-key serenity continued with the hotel's clientele, divided between the genteel grandparents of Eurotrash and the odd knowledgeable American willing to trade glitz and edgy and ironic for a decent night's sleep. I knew the Fauborg because I drank there. The lounge at the back was smallish and dim with nothing to prove, paneled in dark rift oak and hung with middling Barbizon landscapes. The eighty-year-old hunchback behind the bar concocted the best Sidecar in town and Robin likes Sidecars. An assortment of pianists, mostly former studio musicians on pension, worked the big black Steinway in the left-hand corner, never intruding upon the pleasant buzz of conversation and the harmonious clink of crystal glasses. The staff was attentive without being nosy, the snacks were decent, and you left the place feeling as if you'd been recivilized. Robin and I spent a lot of Sunday evenings in a cracked leather rear booth, holding hands, nibbling on cheese crackers, and inhaling Gershwin. One Saturday morning in the spring, Robin was delivering a new guitar to an aging rock star who lived in the flats of Beverly Hills and the drive took her past the Fauborg. A sign strung up over the fanlight announced: LAST NIGHT TOMORROW: COME CELEBRATE-OR MOURN-WITH US. THANKS FOR THE GOOD TIMES. The Family of Marcel Jabotinsky Robin shouldn't have been surprised; the previous week we'd shown up at a Thai place we'd enjoyed for half a decade only to find an abyss surrounded by chain-link where the building had stood. The month before that, she'd run into an old high school friend and asked how her husband was. "Which one?" "Jeff." The woman laughed. "Jeff's ancient history, sweetie. Cliff's recent history but he's gone, too." Tissue paper city. Robin said, "Not much of a choice, is it? Surrender to the inevitable or risk a whole bunch of mawkish nostalgia." We sat on the living room couch with Blanche, our little French bulldog, squeezed between us and following the back-and-forth. I said, "I can go either way." She pulled on a curl, let it spring back. "What the heck, I'll never get a Sidecar that good and it's a chance to put on a dress." "I'll wear a suit." "I like you in a suit, darling. But not the black one. Let's pretend it won't be a funeral." Who knew?<br><br>CHAPTER 2 <br><br>We showed up at nine p.m. The light behind the fanlight was dingy. Crescent Drive was depopulated except for a man with a walkie-talkie leaning against a parking meter just north of the hotel. Thirties, tall, broad, with short yellow hair, he flashed us a slit-eyed appraisal before returning to watching the empty street. His suit was black and it draped his bulk uneasily. An interesting bulge swelled his breast pocket, a spiral cord ran from an earpiece down the back of his collar. Robin whispered, "If someone needs serious guarding, where are the paparazzi?" I said, "Good question. They swarm like blowflies at the first whiff of moral decay." "Some flies are kept like pets. Once I was delivering a mandolin to Bite and sat in his kitchen as his publicist phoned the paps to tell them where The Star would be for lunch." Something made me turn back to Mr. Black Suit. His head jerked away quickly and he studied the sidewalk; he'd been watching us. Despite the theatrical apathy, his shoulders were tight, his profile less animate than Rushmore. We must've lingered too long because he half turned and stared. Robin smiled and gave a fluttery finger-wave. Her curls were wild, copper- bright in the moonlight, her dress a tight black tulip, set off by red stilettos. Usually that has its effect. Black Suit was no exception and he smiled back. Then he stopped himself, returned to reviewing the pavement. Robin said, "Guess I'm losing my touch." "He's a robot." "I used to be good with machines." A push of the brass door leading to the Fauborg's lobby plunged us into a sooty, demi-darkness that turned the Damson-plum carpeting to soil-brown. All the furniture was gone, no one worked the desk, gray rectangles marked the walls where paintings had been removed. One thing hadn't changed: the familiar olfactory stew of roasted meat, disinfectant, and grassy French perfume. The ancient air conditioner thumped the ceiling at odd intervals but the air was close, musty, dank. Robin squeezed my arm. "This might be a bad idea." "Want to leave?" "You and me quitters? Not in our DNA." Half the light fixtures had been removed from the lounge. The room was a cave. As my eyes adjusted, I made out the overstuffed leather and green plaid seating. Here, too, the artwork was gone. Same for the big black Steinway with its gigantic brandy snifter for tips. Tinny music seeped into the room from an unseen speaker. An easy- listening FM station. As we stood waiting to be seated, Barry Manilow was replaced by a commercial for auto insurance. Like pedestrians in a fog, the other patrons materialized gradually. A group of handsome white-haired people in their sixties who looked as if they'd driven in from San Marino, a quartet of well-dressed continental types ten years older, both men wearing ascots. One exception to the maturity motif: two tables from our usual corner a young woman in white sat alone, checking her watch every fifteen seconds. No one came forward to greet us and we settled behind a scarred coffee table stripped of snacks, flowers, candles. The insurance commercial ran on. Glass rattled from the bar. Gustave wasn't bent over the slab of polished oak. In his place, a grim, big-chested brunette who looked as if she'd finally given up on a film career mixed what looked like a standard Martini while consulting a cheat-sheet. The concept of gin with a splash of vermouth seemed overwhelming and she grimaced. Clots of moisture created tiny reflecting pools along the bar-top as her fumbling fingers spilled as much booze as they splashed into the glass. She took a deep breath, reached for an olive, shook her head, and put it back in the bowl, health code be damned. Her third attempt at carving a lemon twist was partially successful and she handed the drink to a server I'd never seen before. Looking too young to be allowed in a place where spirits flowed, he had floppy dishwater hair, a soft chin, and a dangerously overgrown bow tie. His red jacket was a flimsy cotton rental, his black pants ended an inch too soon. White socks. Black tennis shoes. Ralph, the Fauborg's waiter for decades, had never deviated from an impeccable shawl-lapel tux, starched white shirt, plaid cummerbund, and patent-leather bluchers. Ralph was nowhere to be seen, ditto for Marie, the middle-aged Savannah belle who split busy shifts and offered naughty one-liners with refills. Red Jacket brought the Martini toward the young woman in white, plodding cautiously like a five-year-old ring-bearer. When he arrived, she dipped her head coquettishly and said something. He scurried back to the bar, returned with three olives and a pearl onion on a saucer. As the commercial shifted to a pitch for the latest Disney movie, Red Jacket continued to linger at the girl's table, schmoozing with his back to us. She wasn't much older than him, maybe twenty-five, with a sweet oval face and huge eyes. A white silk mini-dress bared sleek legs that tapered into backless silver pumps. A matching silk scarf, creamy as fresh milk, encircled her face. The head covering didn't fit the skimpy dress; winter on top, summer on the bottom. Her bare arms were smooth and pale, her lashes too long to be real. She used them to good effect on the waiter. The watch on her right arm sparkled with diamonds as she consulted it again. The waiter made no attempt to leave as she pulled something out of a white clutch. Ivory cigarette holder that she rolled slowly between slender fingers. Robin said, "Someone's channeling Audrey Hepburn." The girl crossed her legs and the dress rode up nearly crotch-high. She made no attempt to smooth it. I said, "Audrey was a lot more subtle." "Then someone else from that era. Hey, maybe she's who Dudley Do- Right's guarding." I looked around the room. "Can't see anyone else who'd fit." "Someone that cute all alone?" "She's waiting for someone," I said. "That's the fifth time she checked her watch." "Maybe that's why I thought of Audrey. Roman Holiday, poor little princess all on her lonesome." She laughed and snuggled against me. "Listen to us. The chance to be together and we're messing in someone else's business." The girl produced a cigarette, fit it into the holder, licked the ivory tip before inserting it between her lips and half...</p><h2>The Egyptians</h2><p>Egypt&#39;s enduring civilization described in fourteen stages which progress from ancient beginnings to contemporary time.</p><p></p><h2>Beloved: Henri Nouwen in Conversation</h2><p>In this rare, previously unpublished interview Henri Nouwen, one of the most deeply loved spiritual teachers of recent times, reflects on themes that were central to his life and thought.<br><br><i>Beloved</i>&nbsp;records -- in both spoken and written form -- a treasured conversation that took place in the summer of 1992 at a retreat center in England.

Burroughs (1914-1997)&#x2014;guru of the Beat Generation, controversial&nbsp;ï¿½minence grise of the international avant-garde, dark prophet, and blackest of black humor satirists&#x2014;had a range of influence rivaled by few post-World War II writers. His many books include <b>Naked Lunch</b>, <b>Queer</b>, <b>Exterminator!</b>, <b>The Cat Inside</b>, <b>The Western Lands</b>, and <b>Interzone</b>.As Burroughs's last book of prose (The Cat Inside, 1992) demonstrated, his publishers will print anything by the octogenarian hipster, even a silly cat book. This latest purports to be a novel, but it's really more random scribbling by the Nike sneaker shill, whose media image far exceeds his achievement as a writer. These ragged, disjointed paragraphs chronicle a year or so of Burroughs's dream life, which is much less lurid than one would expect. Sure, there are drugs (hash, heroin, morphine, laudanum, etc.) and cameos by all his friends living and dead (Brion Gysin, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Paul Bowles, Ian Somerville, etc.). But the sex is nondescript (``sex with James'' or ``made it with Ian''); the places all familiar to Beat groupies (Tangier, Paris, London, and Lawrence, Kans.); and the familial stuff, which has passed into legend, is just alluded to (shot wife playing Wm. Tell; son dead at an early age). Burroughs likes to show his knowledge of guns (``.45 Ruger APC and Long Colt Cylinder'') and frequently expresses his preference for cats over dogs and people. Some vintage moments include a dream of a cockroach stuck in his ear and of a man scooping his brains from his skull to eat. Burroughs really comes alive, though, when he leaves his dreamscapes to explicate. A dream of a ``shitting woman'' leads to a long and sordid anecdote about a ``queen'' friend married to a wealthy woman with a severe colon problem. Burroughs's political commentary amounts to some dated rants about Anita Bryant, Ronald Reagan, and the CIA. His claim to total honesty and authenticity leads him to debunk Ted Morgan's view of him as a ``literary outlaw.'' His waking thoughts dwell sentimentally on cats, with occasional riffs that remind one of the old Burroughs. Die-hard fans will no doubt scoop this up, others need not go beyond Naked Lunch, preferably in David Cronenberg's movie version. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her husband, William, was a wealthy rice planter who owned four plantations and 337 slaves. Her thirteen children included two Harvard scholars, seven world travelers, three socialite daughters, a U.S. Navy war hero, six Confederate soldiers, one possible Union collaborator, a Confederate firebrand trapped in the North, an expatriate bon vivant in France, and two adventuresome California pioneers. <p>Mary&#x2019;s World illuminates in lavish detail the world and psyche of this wealthy, well-educated, highly-principled nineteenth-century Southern planter's wife. This biography was drawn directly from over 2,500 pages of Mary&#x2019;s unpublished letters, journals and diaries, none of which, she could have imagined, would ever be read by strangers. Therein lies their power. </p><p>In her own words, Mary tells us about the joys, sorrows, frustrations, and terrors she and her family faced before, during, and after the Civil War. We also learn about the vastly different lifestyles, food, clothing, and experiences of their 337 slaves. Mary&#x2019;s World also pays special attention to Lucretia &#x201c;Cretia&#x201d; Stewart, Mary&#x2019;s favorite servant, Cretia&#x2019;s husband, Scipio, and their free descendants, some of whom worked for Mary&#x2019;s grandchildren well into the twentieth century. </p><p>Between 1861 and the Union occupation of Charleston in 1865, Mary and her husband, William, stood helpless as two sons were killed, another was driven insane, their slaves were freed, their entire social class was destroyed. Mary felt that God had forsaken her and the the Confederacy. Unable to adapt to the realities of post-war life, she and William died forlorn relics of The Lost Cause. How they, their children, and slaves lived before the Civil War, clung desperately to life in the eye of the maelstrom, and coped &#x2013; or failed to cope -- with its bewildering aftermath is the story of this book. The letters and images they left behind offer priceless insights into the roots of Southern social history.</p></p><p>Mary Pringle's letters, journals, and account books show her as a woman resolutely determined to meet her responsibilities in a world where the veneer of a life of ease often masked deep fissures. As Victorian and Southern culture insisted, Mary was expected to fill many roles: * A charming, dutiful, and fertile companion to her husband; <br>* A nurturing and instructive mother to her thirteen children; <br>* A practical manager of the Miles Brewton House, the opulent Palladian mansion in which she lived; <br>* A responsible mistress of her thirty-two house slaves; <br>* A benevolent patron of the poor and pillar of her church; and <br>* An indestructible vessel which preserved and passed on her ancestors' knowledge, traditions, values, beliefs, and property. <p>Yet just below the surface of her culturally ordained skin lay a woman powerless to control major areas of her own life: <br>* Born into a family wealthy for generations, and despite her own inherited wealth, she watched helplessly as her husband ran their family into financial ruin. <br>* The wife of a major Southern slaveowner, she became convinced that slaveholding was morally indefensible and was in conflict with Biblical teachings. <br>* A woman of great intelligence and learning, she was forced to live out her dreams vicariously through her sons, while she watched her daughters become imprisoned by the same rules which prevented her from achieving her own potential. </p><p>Mary Pringle was a vibrant woman torn between her own needs and aspirations and the limitations imposed upon her by Southern Victorian society. Mary's World is an intimate, visceral window into the heart and mind of a well-intentioned woman whose entire world and value system was ground to dust by the grist mill of historic change.</p>The thirteen-year odyssey which evolved into Mary&#39;s World started in 1988 with a phone call from my alma mater and former employer, The South Carolina Historical Society. Peter Manigault, publisher of the Charleston News and Courier and owner of the Miles Brewton House, was preparing to restore the house and donate an enormous collection of family historical papers to the Society. Funded by a grant which was administered by the Society, I spent two years reading, abstracting, arranging, and boxing those 9,000 pages of papers and records which came to be known as the Alston-Pringle-Frost manuscript collection. In the process, I came to realize what a broad, clear window these papers provided into that stormy period of American history: the two decades before and after the Civil War. Then, on my own, with Mr. Manigault as my chief consultant, and two distinguished historians, Drs. George C. Rogers, Jr. and Theodore Rosengarten as my chief manuscript advisors, two years of writing followed. That, plus another year of rewriting and editing, resulted in this book. It was a once-in-a-lifetime honor to be the first scholar granted unlimited access to this extraordinary collection of priceless historical papers and images. It&#39;s my hope that readers will find the book as interesting and useful as I found the project challenging and exciting.</p><h2>Whose Body?: A Lord Peter Wimsey Novel</h2><p>There&#39;s a corpse in the bathtub, wearing nothing but a pair of pince-nez spectacles. Enter Lord Peter Wimsey, the original gentleman sleuth. Urged to investigate by his mother, the Dowager Duchess of Denver, Lord Peter quickly ascertains that the sudden disappearance of a well-known financier is in some way connected to the body in the bathroom. But discovering exactly which way they&#39;re related leads the amateur detective on a merry chase. Written by a master of the detective story, this atmospheric tale abounds in the cozy delights of an English murder mystery. Dorothy L. Sayers ranks with Agatha Christie as a defining author of the genre. A novelist, essayist, and medieval scholar, Sayers was among the first women to receive an Oxford degree, and her translations of Dante remain in wide circulation. This novel marks the debut of her most popular creation, Lord Peter Wimsey, whose continuing adventures unfold amid the lively world of upper-crust British society in the 1920s.</p><p>Dorothy L. Sayers, long considered one of the top mystery authors of our day, has excelled herself in this delightfully macabre tale which centers around the disappearance of a wealthy financier and the discovery of a nude corpse, wearing a golden pince-nez, in a bathtub. Sayer's most renowned amateur detective, the engaging and amusing Lord Peter Wimsey, sets out to unravel this puzzling case under the jealous eye of Scotland Yard. Needless to say he succeeds in solving things to everyone's ultimate satisfaction, but only after a series of bloodcurdling and hair-raising episodes that will hold you spellbound with anticipation.<p>Here is a truly rare find for anyone who is interested in top-flight crime fiction.

With impressive candor and detail, she recounts those struggles here, offering a Native woman&#x2019;s perspective on California history and the production of knowledge about indigenous peoples. Readers interested in tribal history will find in her story a spiritual counterpoint to prevailing academic views on the complicated reemergence of a Chumash identity. Readers interested in environmental studies will find vital eyewitness accounts of movements to safeguard important sites like Painted Rock and San Simeon Point from developers. Readers interested in indigenous storytelling will find Chumash origin tales and oral history as recounted by a gifted storyteller. <br><br>The 1978 Point Conception Occupation was a turning point in Pilulaw Khus&#x2019;s life. In that year excavation began for a new natural gas facility at Point Conception, near Santa Barbara, California. To the Chumash tribal people of the central California coast, this was desecration of sacred land. In the Chumash cosmology, it was the site of the Western Gate, a passageway for spirits to enter the next world. Frustrated by unfavorable court hearings, the Chumash and their allies mobilized a year-long occupation of the disputed site, eventually forcing the energy company to abandon its plan. The Point Conception Occupation was a landmark event in the cultural revitalization of the Chumash people and a turning point in the life of Pilulaw Khus, the Chumash activist and medicine woman whose firsthand narrations comprise this volume. <br><br>Scholar Yolanda Broyles-Gonzï¿½lez provides an extensive introductory analysis of Khus&#x2019;s narrative. Her analysis explores &#x201c;re-Indianization&#x201d; and highlights the newly emergent Chumash research of the last decade.<br><br>In the world of book publishing, this volume from a traditional Chumash woman elder is a first.

Risking his own freedom and career, Anthony sailed across international waters to Australia, to rescue from hellish imprisonment the group of British-soldiers-turned-Irish-rebels named "The Fremantle Six." The successful escape and hostility the vulnerable Catalpa overcame both from the British Royal Navy and furious seas make Anthony's historical voyage legendary. 8 pages of photographs add to this true story of daring on the high seas. "Narrated in fascinating and breathtaking fashion. ... The subject matter and fine writing make this book exhilarating."&#x2014;Associated Press "A seafaring adventure, an Irish nationalist version of Treasure Island." &#x2014;Chicago Tribune "Truth may routinely be stranger than fiction, but seldom is it as suspenseful as this story."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly "Genuinely epic ... a fascinating adventure."&#x2014;Kirkus Review</p><p>Truth may routinely be stranger than fiction, but seldom is it as suspenseful as this story of the 1876 rescue of six Irish rebels from Britain's infamous prison colony in Fremantle, Australia, by the American whaling ship Catalpa. Despite its title, the book covers far more than just the rescue ship's voyage, bringing to life the web of political interests and conflicts among Ireland, England and the U.S. toward the end of the 19th century. In his fast-moving narrative, journalist Stevens (The Mayflower Murderer and Other Forgotten Firsts in American History) tells how the six Irish members of the British Armed Forces were recruited and then arrested for treachery because of their allegiance to the rebellious Fenian movement for Irish independence. He describes the ordeal of the Irishmen in prison, as well as the plotting of the clandestine rescue mission, which launched from New Bedford, Mass., and took a year to complete in the face of hostile British forces. The writing is solid if workmanlike. Stevens doesn't shrink from getting into the heads of his subjects, and takes some liberties in reconstructing their thoughts and actions in minute, novelistic detail. The freewheeling approach may trouble some readers, especially as Stevens doesn't cite sources (he's based much of the book on the firsthand account of Catalpa captain George Anthony). Ultimately, however, the action-packed international intrigue and Stevens's keen sense of pacing carry the book; readers who can put aside their skepticism will be riveted. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Stevens (Rebels in Blue) presents a stirring account of a most dramatic episode in the history of the Irish struggle for independence. After the attempted uprisings of the 1860s, many Irish were arrested, including a number of Irishmen serving in the British army who had taken the Fenian oath. Some of these ex-soldiers were later transported to Australian prisons. One, John Boyle O'Reilly, made a dramatic escape from Fremantle prison in Australia and, after reaching the United States, worked with the Irish organization Clan Na Gael to secure the freedom of the six compatriots he left behind (see Fanatic Heart: A Life of John Boyle O'Reilly, 1844-1890). In a splendid example of boldness and daring, the clan purchased a whaling ship, sailed to the rescue of the "Fremantle Six," and brought them back to the United States. A cause c&#x201a;l&#x160;bre at the time, the rescue was a major embarrassment to the British. This first book-length account will interest public library patrons who enjoy both a good story and a good history. It is also appropriate for collections of Irish history in the academic setting.

My answer has never changed&#x2014;it is Gordie Howe. And so, being asked to write a foreword for Gordie Howe&#x2019;s memoir is a great honor for me. </p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure that younger generations of sports fans realize just how good Gordie Howe was as a hockey player. Certainly, people know he is one of the legends. I observed that firsthand when he attended a Canucks&#x2013;Sharks game in 2013. When the TV cameras spotted him and put his face on the Jumbotron, the place erupted in a spontaneous standing ovation. Players from both teams stood at their respective benches, everyone reluctant to line up for the face-off. So, yes, there is a healthy respect for Number 9.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m not just talking about being <i>one</i> of the greatest hockey players ever. I am talking about being <i>the</i> greatest player ever. Period. </p><p>Think of it this way: Today, if a player cracks the top five in scoring in the NHL, he&#x2019;s considered a star. Do it a couple of years in a row and you&#x2019;re a superstar. Alex Ovechkin did it once. Sidney Crosby has done it back-to-back twice. Steve Stamkos managed it four years in a row. You get the idea. You have to be a pretty good hockey player to make that list even once. Well, Gordie Howe did it <i>twenty years in a row</i>. That&#x2019;s right&#x2014;<i>twenty</i>. How do you begin to do justice to a legacy like that? Maybe we should compare him to the greats in other sports. When you look at golf and the way in which that game celebrates legends such as Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, you get a sense of what Gordie Howe means to hockey. </p><p>Gordie is a quiet and humble man. But I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever met anyone with a more determined will to win. If you ever watched him in action during his career, you know that it&#x2019;s hard to describe how he could dominate. We&#x2019;re all taught to play with both hands on our stick. Gordie must have missed that day in hockey school, because he was happy playing with just one. When I came into the league, one thing I noticed after making the jump from junior was just how strong the guys were. And there was Gordie: stickhandling and passing with one hand and pushing the best players in the world off with the other hand. If Gordie wanted to hold on to the puck, there was pretty much no way you were going to get it. </p><p>Hockey fans often wonder what would have happened if Gordie had been in the lineup for the 1972 Summit Series against the Russians. The series came during his first retirement, but I would have liked to see what he did on the ice. Would the Russians have found a way to defend against him? No one in the NHL ever did. And when I say &#x201c;ever,&#x201d; I&#x2019;m talking about more than twenty-five years. No doubt about it, Gordie would have made Canada a better team. </p><p>Coaches usually come up with a game plan to contain the stars on the other team, but there was really no way to contain Number 9 completely. That kind of coaching requires you to identify a weakness, and Gordie didn&#x2019;t have one. What was there to exploit? He could play along the boards with the very best. He could dangle in open ice as well. Try to stand him up and he&#x2019;d knock you down. Outmuscling him was never going to work. You could try to pressure him, but there was hardly a cooler passer in the game. How do you defend against all of that? One thing you didn&#x2019;t want to do, though, was try to get under his skin. That approach can work against a lot of star-quality players. If you&#x2019;re &#x201c;the man,&#x201d; guys are going to take liberties with you. Gordie was definitely the man, but after a while even the toughest guys in the league knew not to stir up the hornet&#x2019;s nest. If you got under Gordie&#x2019;s skin, you would soon wish you hadn&#x2019;t. I say this as someone who once got his stick up a little too high on Mr. Hockey. Not long after what he considered to be a cheap shot, I found myself on my rear end with Gordie looking down at me, a very unfriendly expression on his face. When I asked him about it later, he showed another side of his personality&#x2014;his sense of humor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a very religious player,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s much better to give than to receive.&#x201d; Not too many guys made that mistake twice with Number 9. </p><p>We talk about the role of the &#x201c;enforcer&#x201d; in the game, but Gordie didn&#x2019;t need one. He wasn&#x2019;t just an elite talent, but was something of an enforcer himself. He would stick up for himself and his teammates. Gordie eventually had some teammates he took special care to protect. Playing with his sons Mark and Marty meant that a whole new generation of opponents had to learn to be careful around anyone with &#x201c;Howe&#x201d; on the back of his jersey. A father and two of his boys playing professional hockey at the same time on the same team&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder if that will ever happen again!</p><p>After I retired from the game, Gordie was still playing and doing it well enough to be voted onto All-Star teams. Here&#x2019;s a little history for you: He played in his first All-Star Game in the year I was born. He retired and had been inducted into the Hall of Fame but then returned to the game, still producing nearly a point a game while playing in the NHL. In 1980, the All-Star Game was held in Detroit. Naturally, Gordie was chosen to represent Hartford that year. In many ways, he was a sentimental favorite. Incredibly, that was his twenty-third All-Star Game while playing in his fifth decade as a pro, an unheard of statistic. The average NHL career lasts about five years. And keep in mind that the <i>average</i> NHL player is a very good hockey player. That means that Gordie had greater than four times more All-Star seasons than most very good players have seasons, period.</p><p>Now, there he was, back in Detroit where he had started playing in the 1940s. The fans went crazy. One by one, players were introduced as they came onto the ice. As future Hall of Famers like Larry Robinson, Darryl Sittler, and Guy Lafleur came skating out, the announcer called out their names and the teams they were representing. </p><p>Then it was Gordie&#x2019;s turn.</p><p>&#x201c;From the Hartford Whalers, representing hockey with great distinction for five decades,<i> number 9</i> &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;</p><p>The announcer never got to say Gordie&#x2019;s name. Everyone in Detroit knew who wore number 9. The fans at Joe Louis Arena were on their feet before the announcer had finished, and they remained standing while Gordie stood on the blue line. You could tell he wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do. He would look up and the crowd would roar. Then he would look back down. He wasn&#x2019;t comfortable being the center of attention. But the cheers went on and on. Then the chant went up: &#x201c;Gordie! Gordie!&#x201d; Finally, after several minutes of this deafening roar, the officials were able to have the anthem played in order to start the game. By the way, at the age of fifty-one, Gordie had an assist in the game.</p><p>As I consider his wonderful career today, I realize that Gordie&#x2019;s accomplishments are so impressive that it is almost impossible to understand them by comparing them to those of other players. You can&#x2019;t say that he played like this guy or that guy, because there has never been anyone who played the total game in the way Gordie did. No one has ever combined strength, skill, determination, and longevity in the way Gordie did over all those years. No one captured the respect of players and the adoration of fans like Gordie did. And no one handled that level of fame and stardom with such genuine humility and graciousness. Even today, he still greets fans with the kind of warmth you just can&#x2019;t fake. So you can&#x2019;t talk about how great Gordie was as a hockey player without also mentioning what a great person he is. </p><p>His longevity as a professional hockey player reflects his absolute passion for the game. I believe it was his passion to play that set him apart from his peers. As a young teenager, meeting Gordie for the first time, I already knew he was special. That feeling has not changed. Gordie Howe will always be one of my heroes. And, in my opinion, he will always be the best that ever played. </p><p>Bobby Orr</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>The puck felt good in my hand.</p><p>I&#x2019;d have liked it to be on my stick, but I suppose those days are long past. The only time I get on the ice now seems to be when I&#x2019;m part of an occasion, which is exactly where I found myself last New Year&#x2019;s Eve. Detroit was hosting the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, an outdoor game between the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. The next day, more than a hundred thousand people would turn up at Michigan Stadium to watch Toronto beat Detroit in a shootout. But New Year&#x2019;s Eve was for the old-timers. </p><p>The Wings had asked my old linemate Ted Lindsay and me to drop the ceremonial first puck in an alumni game between the two clubs. Steve Yzerman, retired since 2006, looked like he could still be playing in the NHL as he lined up to take the draw against Leafs captain Darryl Sittler. The weight of the rubber puck was pleasing as I bounced it in my hand and waited for them to come to the circle. I glanced over at Ted, as I had so many times before, and it seemed like it hadn&#x2019;t been that long ago that we&#x2019;d lined up to take the draw for real. We&#x2019;ve both added more wrinkles and our hair is thinner, but he didn&#x2019;t look that much different to me than when we were on the Production Line together.</p><p>More than thirty-three thousand fans had shown up at Comerica Park, the Tigers&#x2019; home field, to watch hockey. I&#x2019;ve been around Detroit so long that I can remember taking batting practice in old Tiger Stadium, when it was still called Briggs Stadium. As much as things change, though, they also stay the same. Hockey, for one, has remained a constant in my life. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether I&#x2019;m in an NHL arena, at a local rink, or on a sheet of ice in the middle of a baseball stadium, when I&#x2019;m around the game I feel at home. It&#x2019;s a good thing, too, since I was such a shy kid. No matter how many people were in the stands, though, nerves were never a problem for me when I played. The ice was the one place I always felt comfortable. Stepping in front of a packed house at Comerica Park, I found that what was true then still held true that day. The faces may have changed, but when I waved to the crowd, it felt as familiar as if I were back at Olympia Stadium. I&#x2019;m lucky for that. I&#x2019;m lucky in a lot of ways. </p><p>I was fortunate enough to play professional hockey for thirty-two years. If you&#x2019;d asked me when I broke into the league if I thought I&#x2019;d still be playing five decades later, I would have said you were crazy. When the Red Wings called me up from their farm club in Omaha in 1946, I just wanted to last the season. From then on, if the team decided to bring me back for another year, I wasn&#x2019;t going to complain. From the time I was a kid, all I ever wanted to do was play hockey. Even at the end of my career, when I was the only guy in the dressing room with grandkids, strapping on my pads every day still felt as normal as ever. The air turning chilly in the fall was like nature&#x2019;s way of telling me to put on my skates and get back to work.</p><p>I ended up watching a lot of the world go by while on the ice. My NHL career started a year after Harry Truman replaced Franklin Roosevelt in the White House. When I retired, Ronald Reagan was only a year away from taking over from Jimmy Carter. In between, I saw seven American presidents pass through office and even had a chance to meet some of them. It was a good long run by nearly any measure. During my first season with the Red Wings, Jackie Robinson was still a year away from breaking Major League Baseball&#x2019;s color barrier. When I hung up my skates for the first time in 1971, he&#x2019;d already been in the Hall of Fame for a decade. In Detroit, we had front-row seats for the birth of Motown. I moved there during the city&#x2019;s boomtown years, when Michigan was the center of the U.S. automotive industry. On the ice, the Red Wings piled up four Stanley Cup victories, and we probably should have won a few more. I managed to put the puck in the net 975 times in my professional career, while setting up scores for teammates on more than 1300 other occasions. Away from the arena, I was lucky enough to meet my beautiful wife, Colleen, and together we raised four wonderful children.</p><p>I like to think that I&#x2019;m a family man first and a professional athlete second. With that said, though, I also know that I have hockey to thank for so many of the good things that have happened to me over the years. The game has blessed me with a lifetime of memories. I&#x2019;ve had a chance to share some of them before, but I&#x2019;ve never taken the time to tell my whole story in one place. It&#x2019;s humbling to think that a shy kid from Saskatoon could write a book that anyone would want to read. As with so many things in my life, I&#x2019;m grateful&#x2014;and still somewhat amazed&#x2014;to be given the opportunity. </p><p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½</p><p>Since retiring, I&#x2019;ve often thought that some of the happiest years of my career were spent in Houston, where I had the chance to play with my sons Marty and Mark. I wasn&#x2019;t the player then that I was during the glory years in Detroit, but how many fathers get the chance to play professional hockey with their kids? It&#x2019;s what brought back the fun and excitement of my youth and kept me going into my fifties. Standing rinkside at the Winter Classic watching Mark&#x2014;who&#x2019;s best remembered as a Flyer, but ended his career in Detroit&#x2014;take the ice for the Red Wings, it was easy for me to recall our years playing together in the World Hockey Association. Now retired for nearly twenty years and nursing a couple of bad disks in his back, I thought Mark still looked as smooth as ever on the ice. The countless laps he put in skating around the rink as a kid were clearly enough to last him a lifetime.</p><p>The alumni game, as exhibition matches often do, started slowly. Time away from the ice combined with a windy day and below-freezing temperatures had everyone more concerned about staying warm and healthy than trying to make a big play. Both squads were filled with players who knew each other well. The Leafs had brought fan favorites such as Doug Gilmour, Wendel Clark, and Borje Salming, while the Red Wings had matched with stalwarts like Brendan Shanahan, Igor Larionov, Sergei Fedorov, and Nick Lidstrom. Everyone was happy to laugh with old teammates and share a smile with former rivals&#x2014;at least at the start of the game.</p><p>Compared to my era, NHL hockey has evolved in ways that are both good and bad. When I watched the alumni game, it was comforting to see that at least one thing hasn&#x2019;t changed: The will to win never goes away. The boys on the ice may have lost a few steps, but once they&#x2019;d warmed up, they couldn&#x2019;t help themselves. It didn&#x2019;t matter how long they&#x2019;d been retired, who they were playing, or where the game was being held&#x2014;no one wanted to lose. At one point, Tiger Williams even started chirping at Chris Chelios for celebrating a goal with a little too much gusto. He wasn&#x2019;t kidding, either. I might have some quibbles with the way the game is played today, but at its core, I know that hockey will always be hockey no matter what yea...</p></p><h2>The Diabetes Food and Nutrition Bible : A Complete Guide to Planning, Shopping, Cooking, and Eating</h2><p>A comprehensive nutrition guide and cookbook in one.

Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick&#x2019;s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn&#x2019;t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife&#x2019;s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge<b>.</b>&nbsp;Under mounting pressure from the police and the media&#x2014;as well as Amy&#x2019;s fiercely doting parents&#x2014;the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he&#x2019;s definitely bitter&#x2014;but is he really a killer?</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, June 2012</strong>: On the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick's wife Amy disappears. There are signs of struggle in the house and Nick quickly becomes the prime suspect. It doesn't help that Nick hasn't been completely honest with the police and, as Amy's case drags out for weeks, more and more vilifying evidence appears against him. Nick, however, maintains his innocence. Told from alternating points of view between Nick and Amy, Gillian Flynn creates an untrustworthy world that changes chapter-to-chapter. Calling <em>Gone Girl</em> a psychological thriller is an understatement. As revelation after revelation unfolds, it becomes clear that the truth does not exist in the middle of Nick and Amy's points of view; in fact, the truth is far more dark, more twisted, and more creepy than you can imagine. <em>Gone Girl</em> is masterfully plotted from start to finish and the suspense doesn't waver for one page. It's one of those books you will feel the need to discuss immediately after finishing because the ending doesn't just come; it punches you in the gut. <em>--Caley Anderson</em></p> <p><b>From Author Gillian Flynn</b></p> <p>You might say I specialize in difficult characters. Damaged, disturbed, or downright nasty. Personally, I love each and every one of the misfits, losers, and outcasts in my three novels. My supporting characters are meth tweakers, truck-stop strippers, backwoods grifters ...</p> <p>But it's my narrators who are the real challenge.</p> <p>In <em>Sharp Objects,</em> Camille Preaker is a mediocre journalist fresh from a stay at a psychiatric hospital. She's an alcoholic. She's got impulse issues. She's also incredibly lonely. Her best friend is her boss. When she returns to her hometown to investigate a child murder, she parks down the street from her mother's house "so as to seem less obtrusive." She has no sense of whom to trust, and this leads to disaster.</p> <p>Camille is cut off from the world but would rather not be. In <em>Dark Places,</em> narrator Libby Day is aggressively lonely. She cultivates her isolation. She lives off a trust fund established for her as a child when her family was massacred; she isn't particularly grateful for it. She's a liar, a manipulator, a kleptomaniac. "I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ," she warns. "Draw a picture of my soul and it'd be a scribble with fangs." If Camille is overly grateful when people want to befriend her, Libby's first instinct is to kick them in their shins.</p> <p>In those first two novels, I explored the geography of loneliness--and the devastation it can lead to. With <em>Gone Girl,</em> I wanted to go the opposite direction: what happens when two people intertwine their lives completely.I wanted to explore the geography of intimacy--and the devastation it can lead to. Marriage gone toxic.</p> <p><em>Gone Girl</em> opens on the occasion of Amy and Nick Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. (How romantic.) Amy disappears under very disturbing circumstances. (Less romantic.) Nick and Amy Dunne were the golden couple when they first began their courtship. Soul mates. They could complete each other's sentences, guess each other's reactions. They could push each other's buttons. They are smart, charming, gorgeous, and also narcissistic, selfish, and cruel.</p> <p>They complete each other--in a very dangerous way.</p><b>GILLIAN FLYNN</b> is the author of the runaway hit <i>Gone Girl</i>, an international sensation that has spent more than ninety-five weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list.

The mice (first seen as an intriguing row of bright tails on the elegantly spare black title spread) are the colors of the rainbow plus white; they, the white text, and the parts of the elephant (as they really are and as the mice imagine them) are superimposed on a dramatic black ground. The real elephant is skillfully composed with textured and crumpled paper in gentle earth tones; in a sly philosophical twist, the form each mouse imagines is the color of the mouse: e.g., Green Mouse says the trunk is a snake, shown as green. On Sunday, White Mouse (the only female) runs over the entire elephant, getting the others to join her; now, at last, with her help, they all understand the whole. Exquisitely crafted: a simple, gracefully honed text, an appealing story, real but unobtrusive values and levels of meaning, and outstanding illustrations and design--all add up to a perfect book.

The problem comes when you can&#x2019;t just walk away, privately shaking your head and wondering where his parents went wrong, because you are the parent, he is your child, and he&#x2019;s going home with you just as soon as you can drag him out to the car and find a way to keep him buckled in. What is a parent to do?<br><br>Why Does My Kid Act Like This?<br>When parents call my office to make an appointment for a child who is about to get kicked out of kindergarten, or a child who has brought them to within half an inch of social isolation from neighbors and friends because of behavior problems, they have one thing on their minds: Why does my kid act like this?&#x201d; Parents mothers in particular are natural scientists when it comes to this question. They spend hours developing hypotheses about why their child acts the way he does, pondering and worrying themselves sick. What mother, way down inside, doesn&#x2019;t suspect that her exploding, tantrum- throwing, melting-down child is just a brat? But if you are one of those moms or dads whose child&#x2019;s tantrums are the stuff of kindergarten legend, simply labeling him as a brat does nothing to quiet those nagging suspicions that something deeper is going on. The problem with the B&#x201d; word is that it fails to tell you why. That why is the itch that has to be scratched if you are to come to a true understanding of how to help your child. As you will soon learn, the answer to why children explode is far more interesting, and far more complex, than the brat hypothesis.<br><br>The first step toward arriving at why is to come to an understanding of the different types of explosions that children display. While most dramatic tantrums may look and sound pretty much the same to the overwhelmed parent who is standing there watching, all explosions are not created equal. I will demonstrate this to you briefly. Before I do, though, I want to ask you to do your best to avoid falling into either of two traps. The first one is confusing symptoms with causes. When working with children who explode, you might be tempted to think that the explosions are the problem, or, in medical terms, the disorder. Common sense should tell you, however, that children do not sit happily playing and then Bang! explode for no reason. There is something hidden, something working beneath the surface that sets them off time after time. The second trap is lumping all of the possible causes of childhood explosions into one heap and claiming that there is a universal technique that can be used to treat them. Such thinking is like saying that a pain in your head must be caused by the same problem as a pain in your leg, your stomach, or your shoulder and that all of them can be treated with an aspirin.<br><br>Steven and Henry Think of explosive outbursts as icebergs. The observable part, that one-tenth that sticks up above the surface, is the yelling and screaming, the bulging eyes and flailing arms, the spitting and kicking and cursing that exploding kids let fly in the midst of their fits. The nine-tenths that we can&#x2019;t readily see are the actual causes of the explosions. This is where we become detectives, entering into the mystery of incredibly powerful forces. Once you learn to consider all of these forces, you will begin to understand why your child is responding to the world in a very specific manner and the blowups will begin to make sense to you. This is not to suggest that you will like or condone your child&#x2019;s explosive behavior. You will, however, understand what makes it happen and be more able to respond in a way that will decrease the explosions. The following two examples will show precisely why the iceberg analogy is useful. Steven and Henry were both first graders, and both were assaulting their peers. Steven did it at the bus stop. Henry did it mainly in the school cafeteria, but also sometimes in the hallways or in the school library. Before coming to my office, the parents of both children had tried time-outs, loss of privileges, rewards, and talking/lecturing/yelling/spanking/bargaining/bribing/ counting, all to no avail. The assaults simply continued. Both boys were in danger of being placed into alternative educational settings. Their schools and other parents had begun to label them as oppositional and explosive and were demanding that something be done quuickly. Steven would strike most parents on first glance as quiet (mousy actually), anxious, and certainly not prone to display the in-your-faaaaace, coequal-with-the-parent attitude typically seen in oppositional children and adolescents. At the bus stop, though, he would climb onto the backs of the other children and pull their hair, or pull them backward off the steps of the bus by their coats or belts. On one occasion, he clawed a child&#x2019;s face so badly that she had to be taken to the doctor&#x2019;s office. Henry, by contrast, was a beefy little guy with a chronic frown. It was easy to believe that he could be an angry actor. His method of assault was more straightforward than Steven&#x2019;s. He would punch the kid he was mad at right in the face. Being roughly a third bigger than most of his peers, he could do a lot of damage. What I found when I got to know Steven better was that his thinking had a marked obsessive streak. He had developed the belief that he had to be the first one on the bus every day. As he walked to the bus stop with his mother, he would begin to whine anxiously if he saw that another child had arrived there before him. The battle that his mother fought with him every morning was precisely the opposite of what goes on in most homes. Most kids have to be threatened to leave in time so as not to miss the bus. Steven would have gladly left an hour early if his mother had been willing to put up with it, and his need to get there first created tension at the breakfast table every morning. Steven believed that he had to be the first one on the bus in the same way that you or I believe that we have to breathe air. The power of this belief caused him to assault any child who tried to get on before him. From his viewpoint, being first was a life-and-death issue.<br><br>Now, back to our friend Henry. He had what is referred to as sensory processing disorder. He wasn&#x2019;t a worrier and he wasn&#x2019;t compulsive in any manner. Instead, he had an exquisite sensitivity to touch or pressure. Tags in his shirts bothered him horribly, and when he was younger, he was guaranteed to pitch a world-class fit if the toe seams of his socks were not lined up just so. He always complained that his clothes were too tight. He would stretch the necks of his T-shirts out so far that they would almost slip over his shoulder. Along with all of this came an exaggerated need for personal body space, because anyone brushing against him, even lightly, sent him into orbit. The bane of children like Henry is the fact that young kids spend lots of time standing in line at school. When other children bumped into him or rubbed against him, he felt assaulted. He hit back out of what seemed to him to be self-defense. The chronic frown on his face was there because he believed he lived in a world in which he was constantly being attacked by others. By identifying the causes of each boy&#x2019;s meltdowns, the solutions became clear, and I am happy to report that Steven and Henry and their parents are now all doing quite well. But it wasn&#x2019;t without some initial head- scratching about the causes of their behavior.<br><br>A Taxonomy of Tantrums All kids have tantrums, meltdowns, and explosions. It is simply part of being a kid. Some of these tantrums and meltdowns come under a heading that I use frequently: painfully normal. What parent hasn&#x2019;t had the experience of dragging a child out of a store, the child engulfed in tears and rage over not getting some particular toy? Incidents like this mean nothing about a child&#x2019;s psychological operations, other than that they are normal. Tantrums, meltdowns, and explosions rightfully become a concern, however, when your child takes them much further than other kids. You are correct to worry when you realize that your child is a powder keg compared to his or her peers. At some point, if it be comes clear to you in the comments you hear from relatives or neighbors or your child&#x2019;s teachers, or in the way other kids avoid your child that something is not right, you need to take action. In this book, I will ignore the painfully normal fits and tantrums that every child experiences, because with time and maturity, they simply go away. Instead, in each of the following chapters, I will focus on the causes and appropriate treatment of these tantrums and explosions that are sure to be detrimental to your child&#x2019;s happiness and success.<br><br>I believe that the primary cause of highly explosive behavior in children (and frankly, even in adults, which makes it all the more important for your child to receive treatment early in life) is what I refer to as road map meltdowns. Explosive children are prone to make assumptions about what is going to happen in the near future. These assumptions their mental road maps of the future can be like little movies&#x201d; of what they think is going to happen next. Road maps get elevated in their minds to the status of 100 percent certain, totally gonna happen probabilities. When what the child believes is about to happen does not come to pass, his road map disintegrates. Parents who say that their child behaves as if his world has ended because they stopped at the drugstore when the child thought they were going straight to the grocery store do not understand just how right they are. When a child&#x2019;s road map does not come true, his world does cease to exist for a few moments. The resulting dramatic tantrum shows us how overwhelmed some children can become when faced with anything unexpected. I will say much more about this issue in chapter 2.<br><br>There is also the issue of defiant behavior versus explosive behavior. I find that there is an alarming confusion among parents, teachers, and others who work with children about the terms defiant child&#x201d; and explosive child,&#x201d; in that they believe these terms to be interchangeable just different words for the same behavior. In reality, these are two distinct sets of issues. While it is true that children who are defiant&#x201d; can be explosive, and children who are explosive&#x201d; can be defiant, the underlying personality characteristics of the two groups are entirely different and require different treatments. In my experience, most explosive children the ones throwing punches in kindergarten or the ones who get down on the floor and throw massive fits tend to suffer from the road map meltdowns just noted above. The truth is that their explosive behavior can also be caused by any of the issues that are discussed in this book. Defiant children (also referred to as oppositional children&#x201d;) aren&#x2019;t particularly nervous or anxious, and aren&#x2019;t particularly bothered by unexpected changes or events unless they prevent them from doing something they were strongly looking forward to, much as any of us would be. Instead, defiant children are exquisitely sensitive to the issue of power who has it, how much they have, and how to demonstrate that no one can make them do anything. From a remarkably early age, they do not like to be told to do anything by anyone. They act the way they do in an attempt to pull equal with their parents and other adults regarding power and influence.<br><br>Another prime cause of explosive behavior has both nothing and everything to do with psychology. In chapter 3, I go to some length to discuss the part that allergies and food sensitivities can play in childhood explosive behavior, particularly in the age group I concentrate on in this book three- to ten- year-olds. The fact that we rarely think about allergies and food sensitivities in relation to behavior tells us just how shortsighted we have become. Parents and professionals alike are apt to launch into complex behavior modification programs or commit to long-term use of mood-stabilizing medications before considering the simple notion that what children eat or drink or breathe just might be having an impact upon their behavior. Allergies and food sensitivities must be ruled out if the true desire is to treat causes, not symptoms. There is considerable dissension even among allergists over this issue. Suffice it to say that over the years, I have become keenly aware that a remarkable number of the exploding, irritable children who get referred to my office for behavioral treatment have bags or circles under their eyes, ruddy ears or cheeks, a chronic runny nose, a history of ear infections, or a history of bouncing off the walls after consuming certain foods or food additives. I am also too aware of the children I see who have been given diagnoses as serious as bipolar disorder, only to have their symptoms greatly diminished after being treated for allergies or food sensitivities.<br><br>There are other equally important issues that we should not ignore regarding explosive behavior. For example, two of the causes of explosive behavior are generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Anxious or depressed children are not just miniature versions of anxious or depressed adults. They act differently. In fact, cranky, explosive behavior can be one of the main symptoms that alert us to these underlying issues of anxiety and depression. There is also the issue of childhood bipolar disorder, which is discussed briefly in chapter 8. Children who suffer from it can be notoriously volatile and unpredictable. There remains, however, considerable disagreement about whether this diagnosis should even be used with young children. Some of this disagreement revolves around the absence of observable periods of manic behavior in children, believed by some theorists to be one of the symptoms necessary to make such a diagnosis. Others argue that edgy, agitated, explosive behavior is the leading edge of childhood bipolar disorder, a predictor of what is to come. It is a difficult diagnostic call to make, because bipolar disorder seems to unfold over time. Its symptoms emerge gradually, until finally it be comes obvious that bipolar disorder is indeed the correct diagnosis. Along the way, bipolar children are almost invariably misdiagnosed as being depressed or as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or oppositional defiant disorder. No doctor has a crystal ball, yet I find that today many try to diagnose bipolar disorder too early, and use medication to treat it before fully exploring other causes.<br><br>What about the relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and explosive behavior? Children who have ADHD, though often highly creative and imaginative, can be disruptive to an entire classroom, and their impulsivity and inability to anticipate the consequences of their behavior often leads to explosions and altercations with adults. There is growing evidence that sleep problems and sleep- disordered breathing can result in explosive behavior, and children with these problems frequently get misdiagnosed as having psychological issues. Sometimes, simply having tonsils and/or adenoids removed can make all the difference in how a child behaves. Maturity also plays a role in explosive behavior. It is a mistake to believe that a child&#x2019;s intellectual development and emotional development unfold at the same pace. Yet how often have you heard an adult say about a child, She&#x2019;s so smart.

Jean-Louis served Marie for fourteen years until 1789 when the Revolution swept across France, its wrath aimed at the extravagances of the Royal Court and those who served it. Fargeon, a lifelong supporter of the Republican cause but a purveyor to the court, was in a dangerous position. Yet he remained fiercely loyal to Marie Antoinette, beyond her desperate flight to Varennes, her execution and even through his own imprisonment and trial. <i>A Scented Palace</i> is a wonderful window into the world of France during its most brutal and violent days.<br></p><p><b>Elisabeth de Feydeau</b> studied the history of perfume at the Sorbonne. She is a professor of the Versailles School of Perfumers and cultural adviser to France's great perfume houses, including Chanel and Guerlain. She was awarded the Prix Guerlain for this book.Feydeau, a professor at the Versailles School of Perfumers, draws on the papers of perfumer Jean-Louis Fargeon to reveal the secrets of his luxurious creations for Marie Antoinette. A native of Montpellier, Fargeon moved to Paris, becoming an apprentice to one of the city's most fashionable perfumers. Fargeon won the queen's favor with a gift of exceptional scented kidskin riding gloves and rapidly gained her confidence; he treated her secret pregnancy-related hair loss and became her loyal friend. Tracing Marie Antoinette's extravagant expenditures and far-fetched follies amid increasingly enraged public opinion, Feydeau charts the fall of the house of Versailles, Marie Antoinette's decline during her imprisonment and Fargeon's own fate. While the perfumer declared himself to be a Republican, he was also a wealthy man with royal connections and thus a natural target for the Revolution. While arrested, he managed to escape trial. Feydeau's modest tome is sympathetic to Marie Antoinette; rather than provide much historical context, it spotlights the intimate life of the palace, excelling chiefly in explanations of fascinating 18th-century beauty secrets, from black adhesive taffeta beauty spots to swan's down powder puffs. Botanical appendixes list the ingredients and methods of Fargeon's influential unguents. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern, friends and business partners for fifty years, have in many ways taken up their pens and passion for literature in much the same way. The "Holmes &amp; Watson" of the rare book business, Rostenberg and Stern unlocked the hidden secret of Louisa May Alcott's life when they discovered her pseudonym, A.M. Barnard, along with her anonymously published "blood and thunder" stories on subjects like transvestitism, hashish smoking, and feminism.<br><i>Old Books, Rare Friends</i> describes their mutual passion for books and literary sleuthing as they take us on their earliest European book buying jaunts. Using what they call ""Finger-spitzengefuhl,"" the art of evaluating antiquarian books by handling, experience, and instinct, they treat us to some of their greatest discoveries amid the mildewed basements of London's booksellers after the Blitz. We experience the thrill of finding one of the earliest known books printed in America between 1617-1619 by the Pilgrim Press and learn about the influential role of publisher-printers from the 15th century.<br>Like a precious gem, <i>Old Books, Rare Friends</i> is a book to treasure about the companionship of two rare friends and their shared passion for old books.</p><p>Like <i>84, Charing Cross Road</i>, Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern's charming bibliocentric memoir is as much about relationships as it is about books. <i>Charing Cross</i> chronicled the decades-long epistolary friendship between American book lover Helene Hanff and Frank Doel, the equally devoted British bookseller in the London shop from whom she bought many of her treasures. Rostenberg and Stern's book once again proves how a passion for great literature can make for fast friends. And in their case, these two octogenarians occupy the same geographical space, sharing both their professional and private lives. <p> In their introduction, Rostenberg and Stern write: "Several readers inferred ... that our relationship was a Lesbian one. This was a misconception. The 'deep, deep love' that existed and exists between us ... has no bearing upon sex." With that out of the way early on, the two recount the stories of their lives in alternating sections. And oh, what lives they've had! From identifying some of Louisa May Alcott's previously anonymous early writings to traveling the world in search of rare volumes and pamphlets, they have done and seen it all. Successful antiquarian book dealers Rostenberg and Stern undoubtedly are, but as this memoir makes clear, their greatest accomplishment just might be that rarer commodity of friendship that lasts a lifetime. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>This breezy dual autobiography of two writers and antiquarian- book dealers points up their extraordinary accomplishment in spheres of endeavor long dominated by men. Octogenarian New Yorkers Rostenberg, a historian of early printers and commentator on bibliographical subjects, and Stern, biographer and unmasker of Louisa May Alcott as the unknown writer of ``blood-and-thunder'' thrillers, have been friends since they were students at Columbia University and Barnard College, respectively. In alternating chapters the two detail their early lives, educations, and experiences as innocents abroad, but their story doesn't really heat up until the young Stern, with the economic freedom of a Guggenheim Foundation grant, begins working with clues from Little Women and other sources, as well as some key help from her friend Leona, to lay out the record of Alcott's ``deviational narratives,'' written pseudonymously for the pulp magazines of her day. For Rostenberg, with her academic background in 15th-century books, or incunabula, professional appreciation of vellum, morocco, and calfskin was a natural path. Descriptions of their publications and the growth of their joint business are coupled with firsthand accounts of rare book and pamphlet discoveries abroad and sales to US libraries and academic institutions. Highlights include the sale in the 1960s of several en bloc collections, such as that of the inimitable 16th-century imprint the Aldine Press, Venice, and a marvelous subject collection on Florence with more than 300 works, including Medici family histories, papal bulls, and an illustrated first edition Vasari Lives of the Artists (both collections went to the University of Texas). Of interest for the Alcott material alone, but the light-handed, nontechnical accounts of the uncommon duo's experiences as women antiquarians also make pleasurable reading for anyone immersed in the world of books.

Although not gilded, many of the pictures have the look and feel of illumination. Moses is beautifully portrayed, strong even when his hair is white. There are also some amazing pictures that will demand second and third looks, especially the full-page painting of Aaron's snake devouring the snakes of the pharaoh.

Although Beneduce (previously paired with Spirin for Philipok) writes smoothly, her text presumes familiarity with the subject (for example, it starts as Moses's mother, without any explanation, sends the baby down the Nile in a basket), but it also skirts the difficult questions. This Moses doesn't kill any Egyptians in his youth (he strikes down a guard, which displeases the pharaoh), and this God doesn't harden the pharaoh's heart. Although Beneduce enumerates the plagues in all their miseries, the exchanges aren't quite so lusty: "Now, won't you agree to let my people go?" Moses enquires of the pharaoh. But Spirin continues to outdo himself with his pencil and watercolor illustrations. He combines Western European painterly traditions with a hint of Egyptian composition. For example, in a scene of the pharaoh's daughter discovering the infant Moses, the princess and maidens are all shown in profile, on a nearly flat plane, but rendered in exquisite detail, from the folds of their diaphanous gowns to the gems in their headpieces. Framing an extract from Exodus are tiny scenes of Moses's and Aaron's visits to the pharaoh, a treatment one mighGrade 3-5--Spirin's enthralling pencil-and-watercolor illustrations give the familiar Exodus story a rich and exotic look.

His mouth set hard, his eyes piercing, he was not the promise of peace, repose, and eternal joy with the Almighty.<br><br>Lying underneath this imposing marble tomb rested the bones of Francisco Selisse, born January 12, 1731. Died September 10, 1784. Historians still puzzle over exactly how he was murdered. Three other people stood in the room when it happened. The stories varied, but no one denied that Francisco had been stabbed to death.<br><br>Big Rawly, the plantation on which this sordid event occurred, looked much as it did in 1784. Brick or clapboard, most early Virginia homes resembled one another. In general, the wealthy wanted Georgian homes, but Big Rawly, modeled after a French chï¿½teau, down to the stables and outbuildings, never failed to impress.<br><br>Harry had played there as a child with children from the neighboring estate Beau Pre, Big Rawly itself, plus those children whose mothers drove them to the estate. The estate&#x2019;s owners, the Holloways, had children, loved children, and were welcoming to any and all. Susan Tucker, Harry&#x2019;s best friend, was their granddaughter.<br><br>Francisco and Maureen Selisse had been childless, and this gaggle of children might have pleased them. Hard to say, for their reputation for ruthlessness endures to this day.<br><br>The cemetery in which this imposing tomb commanded center stage was said to be haunted. As a child, Harry had steered clear of the graveyard, and even as an adult that hard-ï¿½eye stone angel gave her a shiver. Over the centuries, many declared they had seen ghosts here, but with a consideration praiseworthy in the disembodied, the departed never disturbed children.<br><br>Now, as an adult, as Harry passed the place, rumbling on the narrow road leading out of Garth Road, she wondered if this consideration would always hold true.<br><br>Turning left, heading for Crozet, she noted dark clouds backing up behind the Blue Ridge. Never a good sign. Accompanying her in her old 1978 F-ï¿½150 sat Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat, and Pewter, the gray cat. Tucker, a corgi, was also present and always ready to help. The same could not be said of the cats.<br><br>They reached another left turn, which wound a few miles down to old Three-ï¿½Chopt Road, Route 250. Given the threat of a storm, Harry chose this faster route instead of the pleasant drive to Whitehall, where she would also turn left to head home.<br><br>Coming at her in the opposite direction, a red Camry flew around a curve up ahead. On such a twisty road, Harry thought it best to be alert. She had stopped, put her left flasher on, when a tremendous clap of thunder startled her and her passengers.<br><br>Immediately after, the red Camry swerved straight at them. The car appeared totally out of control. Harry hit the gas, and the vehicle missed her truck bed by inches. She quickly surged ahead before turning around in the small Mt. Olivet church parking lot up ahead. Returning to the turnoff, she found the red Camry nosed into the low runoff ditch. Its wheels spun, the motor kept running.<br><br>Turning onto Owensville Road, Harry pulled as far as she could off to the side. Closing the door as the first raindrop fell, she ran to the Camry. A middle-ï¿½aged woman was slumped over the wheel and did not respond to Harry&#x2019;s rapping on the window. Recognizing the driver, Barbara Leader, who had been in the class behind her at high school, Harry rapped louder. &#x201c;Barbara!&#x201d;<br><br>No response.<br><br>Fortunately, the door was not locked. Harry opened it, touched Barbara&#x2019;s shoulder. No response. She took her pulse. No pulse. Barbara&#x2019;s head dropped forward. Seeing the glassy eyes, Harry knew there was no hope.<br><br>Racing back to her truck, Harry climbed into the bed where she kept her tool box, yanked out two flares, and ran back, putting one on each side of the Camry to cover both directions of Garth Road. The flares burned about twenty yards from the beached automobile, giving passing motorists time to slow.<br><br>Harry ran back to her truck, hopped in as the rain increased, plucked her cell from the visor where she always tucked it and dialed her friend, her neighbor, and a deputy of the Sheriff&#x2019;s department, Cynthia Cooper.<br><br>&#x201c;Coop. I&#x2019;m at Garth and Owensville Roads. A car has gone off the road. The driver, Barbara Leader, is dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be right there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there any food in the dead lady&#x2019;s car?&#x201d; Pewter asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Pewter!&#x201d; The dog&#x2019;s voice carried a reprimand. &#x201c;Have some respect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why? There&#x2019;s no point in it going to waste.&#x201d; The gray cat was nothing if not practical.<br><br>Trees began to bend low; small branches flew out of them. The sky turned black with the now hard rain, and Harry could barely see ten feet ahead. She hoped passersby would see the flares and her flashers.<br><br>Fortunately, the sudden terrible weather proved a help, keeping more sensible drivers off the road. Within ten minutes, Harry heard the siren, then saw the flashing lights. Heedless of the weather, she jumped out from the driver&#x2019;s seat, hurrying to the squad car.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry, you&#x2019;re soaked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s warm,&#x201d; Harry answered Coop, who wore her slicker.<br><br>The slender officer opened the Camry&#x2019;s door, used her flashlight to glance around. She, too, felt for a pulse. Walking to the passenger side, she opened the door. From the glove compartment, she pulled out registration papers, then returned them.<br><br>Harry sighed. &#x201c;Knew her from high school. She became a nurse. I mean, I didn&#x2019;t know her well, but she was a class behind in school, popular. She was home-nursing Susan&#x2019;s grandfather.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan Tucker, Harry&#x2019;s closest friend, also knew Barbara. Susan&#x2019;s grandfather Samuel Holloway had been governor of Virginia in the early seventies. Diagnosed with leukemia, he&#x2019;d ignored it and kept going, but finally the disease and his advanced age were taking their toll. Barbara was at the farm, Big Rawly, Monday through Friday. The nurse&#x2019;s buoyant personality lifted everyone&#x2019;s spirits.<br><br>&#x201c;At least she died quickly.&#x201d; Cooper exhaled. &#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s some consolation.&#x201d;<br><br>Saddened to see a longtime acquaintance in such a state, Harry simply shrugged. Yes, a lingering death is painful to watch, but a sudden death, especially when the deceased is young, is a shock.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re never too young for a massive heart attack or stroke.&#x201d; Cooper then ordered Harry, &#x201c;You go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait with you until the ambulance comes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go. I heard over the radio driving here that the winds will pick up. This is turning into some kind of storm. We&#x2019;ll catch up later and you can give me what details you have.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in the truck, Harry cut on the motor. The rumble always sounded glorious to her ears.<br><br>&#x201c;No food?&#x201d; Pewter pressed.<br><br>Harry reached over to pet the fat gray. She kept her flashers on, slowly driving down the road. It took her forever to reach St. Paul&#x2019;s, where she turned right. Moving with care, she noticed cars pulled off to the side of the road, cowed by the inclement weather. Branches flew around, a few landing on the pavement and forcing Harry to drive around them. By the time she reached her farm, she uttered a prayer of thanks. It felt like a miracle that she&#x2019;d made it.<br><br>Cooper was right, this was some kind of storm. The rain dropped like a steel gray curtain, and the wind blew dangerous gusts of sixty miles an hour.<br><br>Rolling down her stone-ï¿½covered farm road, she noticed trees that had fallen in the rain. She pulled the truck in front of the barn, ran in, and opened the outside stall doors, all of which opened onto paddocks. She could barely see the horses, huddled with their backs to the wind. She whistled and they happily trotted in, each horse entering his or her stall. Petting her friends as she moved from stall to stall, she closed those outside doors, then closed the big end doors, leaving them open a crack. It wouldn&#x2019;t be too smart in this situation to allow the interior of the barn to keep a higher pressure than the outside.<br><br>The wind screamed. Slipping back outside, she opened the truck door. The cats shot out, flying for the house, nearly colliding as they hit the animal door in the screened porch door.<br><br>Lifting out Tucker, Harry, too, bolted for the house. Tucker, even faster, ran ahead.<br><br>Once inside, she stripped off the wet clothes, dried herself with a fluffy towel, pulled on dry clothes. She left her soggy garments in the shower. She&#x2019;d come back to wring them out and take them downstairs to the washer, but right now she was hungry and worried.<br><br>The lights flickered and went out. She put down food for the animals and tried calling her husband on the cell, as the power was out. She couldn&#x2019;t get through. Not that she was worried about her six-ï¿½foot-ï¿½five-ï¿½inch husband. The equine veterinarian was equal to just about any task, but she wanted to hear his voice.<br><br>The windows rattled. Tucker looked worried.<br><br>The cats did, too.<br><br>Harry knelt down to pet everyone, in case the violence of the storm frightened them. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been through a lot together,&#x201d; she said consolingly.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, we have,&#x201d; Tucker agreed.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy rubbed against Harry&#x2019;s leg. &#x201c;Indeed. We have been through a lot together.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And most of it was your fault,&#x201d; Pewter firmly stated.<br><br>&#x201c;Pewter, you are so full of it,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy shot back.<br><br>&#x201c;Buttface,&#x201d; Pewter grumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;Your language has deteriorated,&#x201d; Tucker criticized her.<br><br>&#x201c;You all drive me to it. On my own, I am perfectly well behaved.&#x201d; The gray cat said this, knowing it was a major fib no one within hearing distance would believe.<br><br>Standing up, Harry smiled. &#x201c;What are you two chattering about?&#x201d; A ferocious gust of wind diverted her attention to the kitchen window. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>She opened the refrigerator door. Without its light, she knew where everything was and pulled out a piece of cheese and a Co-ï¿½Cola. Sitting down, she shoved the cheese in her face, she was so hungry.<br><br>&#x201c;I like cheese, too,&#x201d; Pewter announced.<br><br>Harry glanced down at the cat, who put on her best begging face, then looked up again as the windows rattled more. &#x201c;I wonder if Barbara&#x2019;s ghost will haunt the curve where she went off the road.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Tucker asked.<br><br>Harry shook her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Avenging Angel in that boneyard. Makes me think of ghosts. I don&#x2019;t know if I believe in ghosts, but people say animals can see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to see one,&#x201d; Pewter replied. &#x201c;If I see one, I&#x2019;m going the other way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if the ghost had tuna?&#x201d; the dog said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s different,&#x201d; the fat gray cat responded.<br><br>&#x201c;But wouldn&#x2019;t the tuna be ghost food?&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy tormented Pewter.<br><br>&#x201c;Fish aren&#x2019;t ghosts.&#x201d; Pewter declared this with authority.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy licked her front paw. &#x201c;Maybe Moby-ï¿½Dick is out there, scaring everybody.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really, why would anyone write a giant book about a pea-ï¿½brained whale? If humans intend to write, they should write about cats.&#x201d; Pewter puffed out her cheeks. This was a sore spot for Pewter. She hated Melville&#x2019;s storytelling. When alone, Harry had been known to read to them from Moby-ï¿½Dick. <br><br>Now, as the animals bantered back and forth, Harry thought about the tenuousness of life. She&#x2019;d seen people die. It didn&#x2019;t upset or frighten her. But Barbara Leader wasn&#x2019;t old. Death arrives when He wishes, most generally unannounced. Harry said a prayer for Barbara Leader and then thought again about her spirit. A ghost would not haunt that spot. That was silly.<br><br>She said another prayer and then thought that was the end of it.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t, of course.<br><br>2<br><br>Tuesday, July 12, 2016 <br><br>6:30 p.m.<br><br>Knowing most everyone in the area, Fair drove down the country roads and cleared debris along the way. Doing so, he also checked on the local horses in pastures and poked down driveways, usually finding the owner clearing mess from the storm. The miracle was no horses had been hurt at any place Fair checked. Cell service fluctuated, meaning the weather fouled a lot of stuff. Whatever this storm was, it wasn&#x2019;t over. He just prayed the strong winds wouldn&#x2019;t return.<br><br>Fair finally drove down his own driveway at six-ï¿½thirty p.m. Drenched, tired, hungry, he walked through the door, lights on, thanks to the generator, a five-ï¿½thousand-ï¿½dollar job worth every penny.<br><br>&#x201c;Honey!&#x201d; Harry turned from the stove to embrace him. &#x201c;You look like the dogs got at you under the porch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I resent that,&#x201d; Tucker grumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;If you got at anyone under the porch, only their ankles would be bleeding.&#x201d; Pewter smirked.<br><br>The dog curled her lip. &#x201c;You could do better?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better! I&#x2019;d claw their eyes out. Then I&#x2019;d attack from every direction. They&#x2019;d be shredded like government documents.&#x201d; She puffed up.<br><br>&#x201c;You could sit on them. That might break a few ribs.&#x201d; Tucker reached out a paw to tap her.<br><br>Pewter hissed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me. Don&#x2019;t you dare touch me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, shut up,&#x201d; said Mrs. Murphy. &#x201c;I want to hear what Daddy has to say.&#x201d; She leapt onto the counter.<br><br>Harry was so relieved her husband was home. &#x201c;Sit down. I&#x2019;ve been waiting for you. Tried to call, but even cell service is out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; He wearily dropped his large frame onto a chair at the kitchen table.<br><br>&#x201c;Snow peas. Rice and flank steak. Not French cooking but good for you, plus it&#x2019;s all I could find. Today is shopping day and I never made it.&#x201d; She placed the food in front of him, sitting down to eat, too.<br><br>The animals&#x2019; bowls were full, so they didn&#x2019;t bother either of the humans, especially since Harry had sliced up some steak. Spoiled doesn&#x2019;t begin to cover it.<br><br>&#x201c;How much damage did you see?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>He swallowed a big bite of snow peas, which he loved. &#x201c;Roofs peeled off, especially the standing seam roofs. Just as though a can opener had cut open a side. But only narrow sections. I didn&#x2019;t see one structure without some roof damage. Large branches down. Loblolly pines are uprooted, and here&#x2019;s a strange thing, anytime I passed a creek, downed trees everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The creeks must have acted like a wind tunnel,&#x201d; Harry wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If our cellphones start working again, we can find The Weather Channel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Power crews are everywhere. Gotta give it to the utility companies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Honey, what we give the utility companies is our money, lots of money.&#x201d; Harry was tough about money and service.<br><br>She worked hard for a living, as did her husband, and she expected anyone with whom she did business to do the same. The problem with the utilities and cell servers, Internet stuff, was holding their feet to the fire if they slogged off. If sufficiently disgusted, she cut off the service. She&#x2019;d been studying ways to generate her own power with old-ï¿½fashioned farm windmills. A very exciting cube structure using wind was being developed in Akron, Ohio. Once engaged, she stuck to it, and none of her friends doubted she would be the first to generate her own power with the latest affordable technology. Solar panels sounded good, but days and occasionally a week might pass without ï¿½sunlight, thanks to heavy cloud cover or fog. The surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains had their own weather system. Harry, being born to it, could feel the weather in her bones. Seeing the clouds when they piled up behind the nearby peaks gave her fair ï¿½warning of a storm. She didn&#x2019;t know how fierce it would be, though.</p><h2>The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game</h2><p>This is the story of perhaps the greatest all-around player in basketball history, told straight from his mouth. <br><br>The name Oscar Robertson nowadays gets mentioned in conjunction with one of basketball's seminal accomplishments: the triple-double season. The year was 1962. He was all of twenty-three. No player in basketball history had ever done this. No one has done it since--not Magic Johnson, not Larry Bird, not Michael or Kobe. Throughout the first five years of his career, he averaged a triple-double. <br><br>Videotape does not do him justice. The images are washed out, the colors faded and fuzzy in a manner associated with bygone eras, the fashions and style of play not aging well. And yet there is palpable greatness. <br><br>He was voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on the first ballot, and the National Association of Basketball Coaches named him their player of the century. ESPN put him among their fifty greatest athletes of the century, the National Basketball Association on their list of the fifty greatest players. On and on. So many accolades that they run into one another. <br><br>But the story of Oscar Robertson is about much more than basketball. The story of Oscar Robertson is one of a shy black child growing up in a city so segregated that, until he is ten years old, his only exposure to white people is the distant memory of two Tennessee farm owners whose land his father had worked. It is the story of a poor family, and absent parents working long hours without complaint or reward. <br><br>The story of Oscar Robertson is also the story of the basketball-crazed state of Indiana and Crispus Attucks High School, the high school he led to the state championship. He joins the University of Cincinnati's basketball team and handles the ball on the perimeter in a way that has never been seen before. <br><br>Oscar Robertson enters the NBA with the Cincinnati Royals, who have been just barely holding on as they wait for the fledgling star. Robertson does not disappoint. Moving to the backcourt, he simply revolutionizes the game. <br><br>The story of Oscar Robertson is one of a superstar at the height of his career becoming the president of a union, the National Basketball Players Association, using his fame to try to improve conditions for all basketball players. It is the story of the man who sues the NBA for the right to free agency. <br><br>He is thirty-one years old when the Milwaukee Bucks trade for him. And so Oscar Robertson's story is also the story of a veteran player who joins young superstar Lew Alcindor (the future Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and leads Milwaukee to an NBA championship. <br><br>It is the story of a man who, at thirty-four years old, is forced to leave the game. Who is blacklisted from coaching and is forced out of broadcasting. Who must face questions not about whether he fought the good fight, but how he fought it. <br><br>Two years after he leaves basketball, after six years of legal wrangling, Robertson wins his lawsuit with the NBA. It is the story of a man who revolutionized the game of basketball twice: once on the court, and once in the way that the business of basketball is conducted. It is the story of how the NBA, as we now know it, was built. Of race in America in the second half of the twentieth century. Of a complex hero. An uncompromising man. It is Oscar Robertson's story.</p><p>While <i>The Big O: My Life, My Times, My Game</i> will not disappoint basketball purists longing for Oscar Robertson's play-by-play of favorite games, the attraction of this autobiography is Robertson's perspective on the evolution of the sport and on the racial struggles that were the context of his formative years. Called by many basketball experts the greatest all-around player ever, Robertson earned an astonishing array of honors including an Olympic gold medal, 12 NBA All-Star appearances, the NBA Rookie of the Year award, and the 1964 NBA MVP award. Most remarkably, Robertson remains the only player in basketball history with a triple-double season (double-digit averages for scoring, rebounds, and assists). <p> While Robertson could have easily candy-coated this impressive record for his retrospective, he devotes large sections of his book to the racial battles he faced off court, and his final chapters recount his controversial efforts as an NBA union leader to create free agency, a pension plan, and disability protection for players. In telling his life story, he lays bare the racism and mistreatment he suffered at the hands of individuals and institutions throughout his career, from the Mayor of Indianapolis and Cincinnati University to the NBA and CBS Sports. At times, his critiques can seem excessive (e.g. his discussions of the distortions in the film <i>Hoosiers</i>, while interesting, are repeated a bit too often), and some sections (like his attempts to compare himself to contemporary players) border on self-indulgence. Yet, he seems justified in arguing that his achievements--largely accomplished on second-rate teams, against a back-drop of unprecedented racial strife, and before the modern era of sports-media saturation--are easily underrepresented. In the end, <i>The Big O</i> offers a complex, human portrait to complement a spectacular sports career. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><p>"Every time I get on a basketball court, I'm chasing Oscar Robertson's legend. He set the standard for guys like me. I can only hope, when I'm done playing, that I've come close to what he's accomplished."--JASON KIDD </p><p>"Oscar Robertson is an incomparable superstar. He is also a thoughtful man and a man of vision. If you want insight into what formed Oscar in the crucial years of his youth, look here. It's a great book."--KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR </p><p>"Oscar was one of basketball's great leaders, and his life is one of basketball's great stories. He was unafraid, unabashed, and unmatched in everything he did. There will never be another like him."--BILL RUSSELL </p><p>"Oscar Robertson was never a rookie. He was the measuring stick for how a player should play. It is an honor to know him and to have competed against him. He is a man for the ages."--JERRY WEST</p></p><h2>A Certain Justice</h2><p>When distinguished criminal lawyer Venetia Aldridge defends a young man for the brutal murder of his mother, she views the case as simply another opportunity to demonstrate her brilliance in the courtroom. But within weeks of the trial Aldridge is found dead at her desk, a bloodstained barrister&#x2019;s wig on her head. And as Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard attempts to make sense of events, the murders continue, inexorably spiraling into fresh complexities of horror.<br><br>&#x201c;Shocking . . . fascinating . . . <i>A Certain Justice</i> sucks the reader in right from the dramatic first line.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a P.

Publicly respected but privately loathed, Venetia Aldridge has far more enemies than a brilliant London criminal lawyer should--and at least one of them is determined to do her in. Venetia plies her superior trade in courts that harbor "the illusion that the passions of men were susceptible to order and control," but her past and private life are exceedingly unruly. Her married lover is intent on giving her up; her daughter loathes her; her fellow barristers are determined that she not become the next head of chambers. Even the cleaning women seems to have something on her. <p> The outline alone of this complex novel would take pages (as would the eclectic inventory of players), but P. D. James makes us admire far more than her brilliantly developed plot. James in fact creates a crowded gallery of surprisingly decent suspects, along with one suitably vile creature--who happens to be Aldridge's last client. </p><p> A superior murder mystery, <i>A Certain Justice</i> is also a gripping anatomy of wild justice. James's characters can be overcome by hate, but she is equally concerned with love's manifestations--human, divine, destructive, and healing.</p>"A first-class novelist . . .with a literary flair and an eye as perceptive as her heart." - <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Wounds of God</h2><p>These captivating tales of monastic life are stories of disillusionment, grief, and despair, as well as hope amid trial, and all consuming love of a passionate and tender God.

Paul Revere began his famous midnight ride not by jumping on a horse, but by scrambling into a skiff with two other brave patriots to cross Boston Harbor to Charlestown. Revere and his companions rowed with muffled oars to avoid capture by the British warships closely guarding the harbor. As they paddled silently, Revere's neighbor was flashing two lanterns from the belfry of Old North Church, signaling patriots in Charlestown that the redcoats were crossing the Charles River in longboats. In every major Revolutionary battle thereafter the sea would play a vital, if historically neglected, role. When the American colonies took up arms against Great Britain, they were confronting the greatest sea-power of the age. And it was during the War of Independence that the American Navy was born. But following the British naval model proved crushingly expensive, and the Founding Fathers fought viciously for decades over whether or not the fledgling republic truly needed a deep-water fleet. The debate ended only when the Federal Navy proved indispensable during the War of 1812. Drawing on decades of prodigious research, historian George C. Daughan chronicles the embattled origins of the U.S. Navy. From the bloody and gunpowder-drenched battles fought by American sailors on lakes and high seas to the fierce rhetorical combat waged by the Founders in Congress, <i>If By Sea</i> charts the course by which the Navy became a vital and celebrated American institution.</p><p><b>George C. Daughan</b> holds a Ph.D. in American History and Government from Harvard University. He spent three years in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. He taught at the Air Force Academy and was also director of the MA program of international affairs there. Subsequently, he held a professorship at Connecticut College, and also taught at the University of Colorado, the University of New Hampshire, and Wesleyan University. He now resides in Portland, Maine.Daughan brings a long academic career and solid command of his sources to this provocative history of the origins of the U.S. Navy. Conventional wisdom has the navy beginning in the 1790s. Daughan instead traces its roots to the Revolution. The fleet established by the Continental Congress had a relatively undistinguished career, but Daughan demonstrates that the Americans gained technical experience, produced talented officers, trained seamen and developed a basic understanding of how a navy should be employed. The question then was whether a navy would concentrate too much authority in the central government and risk embroiling the new country in foreign quarrels. By contrast, a coastal defense force of small ships threatened nobody, foreign or domestic. Daughan traces the debate through four administrations, smoothly integrating political with external influences like the Quasi-War with France (1798&#x2013;1800) and the campaign against the Barbary pirates. Not until the War of 1812, when the navy proved critical, did a national consensus emerge that preparing for war was the best way of avoiding one&#x2014;a lesson that remains worth remembering. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A collection that celebrates color and literature at once!&nbsp;<br><br>Discover an enchanting world of lush&nbsp;<b>pink </b>blooms in the mysterious secret garden<br><br>After losing her parents, young Mary Lennox is sent from India to live in her uncle's gloomy mansion on the wild English moors. She is lonely and has no one to play with, but one day she learns of a secret garden somewhere in the grounds that no one is allowed to enter. Then Mary uncovers an old key in a flowerbed - and a gust of magic leads her to the hidden door. Slowly she turns the key and enters a world she could never have imagined.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Craftsman Builder</h2><p>Color photographs reveal the individuality, beauties, oddities, and personal touches of houses imaginatively designed and built by hand, from adobe, wood, ferro-cement, glass, and stone, by men and women throughout the United States</p><p></p><h2>Phantom Stallion #24: Run Away Home</h2><p><p>Samantha can't wait for the holiday break from school.

Gabriel challenges our western and politically-correct notions about Islam, demonstrating why radical Islam is so deadly and how we can halt its progress.</p><p>Brigitte Gabriel speaks her mind:</p><p>*Fundamentalist Islam is a religion rooted in 7th century teachings that are fundamentally opposed to democracy and equality.</p><p>*Radical Islamists are utterly contemptuous of all "infidels" (non-Muslims) and regard them as enemies worthy of death.</p><p>*Madrassas in America are increasing in number, and they are just one part of a growing radical Islamic army on US soil.</p><p>*Radical Islam exploits the US legal system and America's protection of religion to spread its hatred for western values.</p><p>*America must organize a unified voice that says "enough" to political correctness, and demands that government officials and elected representatives do whatever is necessary to protect us.</p><p>Brigitte Gabriel has fearlessly faced down critics, death threats, and political correctness, and is one of the most sought after terrorism experts in the world. <i>They Must Be Stopped</i> is her clarion call to action. Gabriel thoroughly addresses the historical and religious basis of radical Islam, its frightening encroachment into societies around the world, and its abuses of democracy in the name of religion.</p></p><p><p>BRIGITTE GABRIEL is a US-based journalist and news producer who started her career as an anchor for <i>World News</i>, an evening Arabic news program. As a terrorism expert and the founder of the nonprofit organization ACT! for America, Brigitte Gabriel travels widely and speaks regularly on topics related to the Middle East. She has addressed audiences at the FBI, the United States Special Operations Command, the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Joint Forces Staff College, among others.</p><p>Chapter One Islam 101: The East Through Western Eyes</p><p>While I was growing up in Lebanon, I was able to see what the United States and the Western world was all about. Radio and television connected me to the West. I knew what the latest trends and fashions were, who was famous, what was in and was out. Radio gave us the news and TV was loaded with American programming. However, there has always been a lack of information coming from East to West. In fact, there has been a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding about the Middle East over the centuries. Shrouded in a language foreign to many, its heavily censored media controlled and influenced by Islamic leaders and dictators, the mystery continues to this day.</p><p>Westerners do not understand Middle Eastern culture, its religion, Islam, and how Islam as a political and religious ideology drives and impacts every aspect of the culture and its people. Westerners come from a Judeo-Christian background, where the teaching of faith centers on love, tolerance, and forgiveness. They do not understand that the sword of Islam&#x2014;so glamorized on film&#x2014;represents hatred, intolerance, murder, and the subjugation of anyone not Muslim.</p><p>The West&#x2019;s perception of the mysterious Middle East began to come into focus during the past forty years with the rise of the PLO and Ayatollah Khomeini. The world watched one terror attack after another: the 1971 Munich Olympic massacre, the hostage crisis in Iran, the bombing of the marines in Lebanon, the <em>Achille Lauro</em>hijacking and murders, the Pan Am flight that exploded over Scotland, TWA flight 847, and the killing and taking of hostages in Lebanon. At every airport security checkpoint and with every X-ray machine, the crackdown on security at airports drove the dangers home. Terrorism began to be a recognizable problem&#x2014;but not really in the forefront of our minds. Countries and governments failed to connect the dots and realize that even though these terrorist attacks happened in different countries and an different continents, the perpetrators, regardless of their names or what group they belonged to, had something in common: they were Muslims, and their intended victims were always Westerners, Christians, and Jews.</p><p>September 11 brought this reality home. At 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001, the clear blue skies above the New York skyline were changed forever by an explosion of fire and smoke. In less than two hours four airplanes struck U.S. targets. The compelling and horrific images remain etched not only upon the psyche of America, but of all humanity. Via instant live news coverage, people around the world experienced the mass murder of innocents unfold before their eyes. People across the globe shared the new reality of fear and sorrow inflicted on a massive scale by terror in the name of Islam and Allah.</p><p>We needed to learn more about those who in the name of Islam and in homage to Allah would kill and murder not only Americans but anyone who would stand against the tenets of their ancient religion. These warriors of Islam had come to the shores of America not only to destroy the towers in a major U.S. city, but to make a statement. Indeed, they had been making their statement of hatred, intolerance, and bigotry for some time through terrorist activities around the globe. On September 11, 2001, radical Islamists demonstrated they were ready, willing and able to take on any city, culture, or country&#x2014;even the most powerful nation in the world&#x2014;until they alone would rise to be the masters of all humanity.</p><p>The West began to ask questions: Who really knew what Islam stood for? What was the truth about Islam? Is it a religion of peace or not?</p><p>If most of the world has been confused by Islam&#x2019;s relationship to terrorist attacks worldwide, then Yahiya Emerick, the author of <em>Understanding Islam</em>, offers this simple explanation. It&#x2019;s all been a misunderstanding, he claims, perpetrated by the distorted views presented of Muslims in such films as <em>Not Without My Daughter, True Lies, Black Hawk Down, Under Siege,</em> and <em>Delta Force.</em> He declares that these films and their ste reo typical media messages have &#x201c;served to paint Muslims as wife-beaters, bomb-throwers, and swarthy immigrants whose loyalty cannot be trusted.&#x201d;1</p><p>So let&#x2019;s test these claims against the &#x201c;true&#x201d; religion. Let&#x2019;s see if the actual statements found in the Koran support this view. Is Islam a peaceful religion? Or do the proponents of this &#x201c;peaceful&#x201d; religion have a hidden agenda? Does Islam pose a threat to Jews, Christians, and others who possess a religious worldview other than Islam? And do we really need to be all that concerned about the declaration of jihad throughout the world?</p><p>To begin answering these questions we must first take a look at the Arab Middle East, the birthplace of Islam, to learn how its people, their heritage, their customs, and their origins contribute to the twenty-first-century phenomenon called Islamofascism or Islamonazism. Unless we understand where Islam originated, who adopted it, and what they stand for, we will not be able to understand what is driving terrorists today&#x2014;terrorists who commit murder in the name of Islam and claim it is their God-given right to do so.</p><p>Before the advent of Islam, the people of Arabia were polytheists and worshiped many gods, among them divinities such as Al Lat, the sun goddess; Manah, the goddess of destiny; Al-&#x2019;Uzza, the most mighty; and Venus, the morning star.2 They performed rituals and made sacrifices and offerings to deities embodied in trees and or sacred rocks.</p><p>The year 600 A.D.&#x2014;just prior to the life of Mohammed and the birth of Islam&#x2014;found Christians and Jews with rich and flourishing settlements in Arabia where they had built strongholds in the city and vicinity. The city of Yathrib, later to become known as Medina, lay in an oasis 250 miles north of Mecca, and was especially prosperous. Mecca was important because of its location halfway along the west coast of the Arabian peninsula. The city was a commercial hub for traveling nomads. Merchants prospered and grew in numbers as trade and business opportunities increased with the influx of travelers and merchants.</p><p>In addition to commerce, Mecca had another attraction that drew visitors: a sacred rock, a black stone enshrined in the Kaaba representing multiple Arabian gods, and where Arabs worshiped for many centuries prior to Mohammed and the advent of Islam. (The Kaaba is an example of how Islam appropriated aspects of previous religions as its own, just as it appropriated the Jewish Temple Mount in Jerusalem as Mohammad&#x2019;s point of ascent into heaven.)</p><p>Mohammed was born into the Quyrash tribe in Mecca around 570 a.d.3 Around the age of forty, he began receiving revelations which would become the foundation for a new religion later to be called Islam and its followers Mohammedans. In the Koran, this event is described as a sudden explosion one night on Mount Hira where Mohammed spent a month each year. He was visited in his sleep by the angel Gabriel who commanded him to begin reciting. There was about a three-year gap between these first revelations and those that would follow in fragmented fashion, making up what is now known as the Koran.4</p><p>Mohammed preached that the Koran is the correctly written word of God, and any other work allegedly written by God is tainted. The Koran is not only the only untainted version of God&#x2019;s word, but is also a &#x201c;full and final revelation.&#x201d;5 It is because of this understanding and belief in Islamic doctrine and its teaching that radical Muslims today believe that Islam is the superior religion on earth and should be treated accordingly. Therefore, no man-made laws, contracts, negotiations, or conduct that contradicts the Koran should be respected. They believe that all nations must submit to Islam and that Sharia law (Islamic law) should be the governing code of conduct throughout the world.</p><p>ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½</p><p>Five basic Islamic doctrines are embedded in the Koran, and there are five foundational pillars by which those who espouse Islam practice and carry out the beliefs of their religion.</p><p>The first doctrine is that there is only one God and He is self-sufficient and without partners. God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and the creator of all that was and is and what will be. The second doctrine is that there have been many prophets sent by God. These prophets include Noah, Abraham, Jesus, Moses, and Mohammed. The third doctrine is that while God is self-sufficient, He also created angels, of which there are both good and evil. The fourth doctrine is that the Koran, not the Bible, is God&#x2019;s entire and final message to the people. The fifth doctrine is that a final judgment day is approaching for all, when the evil will descend into hell, while the good will ascend into heaven.6</p><p>THE FIVE PILLARS OF ISLAM: FOUNDATIONS OF FAITH AND EMPIRE</p><p>Profession of Faith: Iman.</p><p>Iman is the basic belief in the Oneness of God and the Prophet Mohammed. It is the creed, pivotal confession, and profession of Islam (Shahadah) which declares, &#x201c;Allah is the greatest. There is no god but Allah and Mohammed is His Prophet.&#x201d; Each Muslim must profess these words. For Muslims it confirms that God, as they know Him, is a unique being, unlike any other.</p><p>Prayer: Salat.</p><p>Second, Muslims adhere to regularly scheduled prayers, or Salat, that take place five times during the day. These are physical prayers and are considered a critical act of worship. During the prayers, which Muslims can do alone or with a congregation of other believers, they face Mecca. Through a series of ritual prayers that are said at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and nightfall, they reconfirm themselves and submit to Allah in every area of their lives.</p><p>It is important to stress how important the daily prayers are to the Islamic faith. Once the Islamic faith has been embraced, it is <em>expected</em> that the follower perform th...</p></p><h2>Jurassic Park (gift Edition)</h2><p>An American bioengineering research firm erects a theme park on a Caribbean island, complete with living dinosaurs, and invites a group of scientists to be its first terrified guests</p><p>Unless your species evolved sometime after 1993 when <i>Jurassic Park</i> hit theaters, you're no doubt familiar with this dinosaur-bites-man disaster tale set on an island theme park gone terribly wrong. But if Speilberg's amped-up CGI creation left you longing for more scientific background and ... well, character development, check out the original Michael Crichton novel. Although not his best book (get ahold of sci-fi classic <i>The Andromeda Strain</i> for that), <i>Jurassic Park</i> fills out the film version's kinetic story line with additional scenes, dialogue, and explanations while still maintaining Crichton's trademark thrills-'n'-chills pacing. As ever, the book really is better than the movie. <i>--Paul Hughes</i>I sell books for a living. There are just a handful of authors in the world who sell at the multiple million copy level and if you're a reader you can probably name them just as well as I can. (King, Koontz, Crichton, Rice, Ludlum, Clancy, Grisham, Steel etc.) And yet just because an author sells a lot of copies doesn't mean each time a new one is released it's an event, because everyone's become accustomed to having the author sell well. An event becomes defined by the intensity of the sale and the magnitude by which the public is clamoring. Remember Peter Benchley's JAWS? Thanks to the movie, that was an event. But I didn't sell JAWS, which leads me to the other point. You may see a selling "event" once during a career, if at all. I happened to be selling JURASSIC PARK when the movie released and I don't expect to have an experience quite like it ever again. Whereas a big best seller for me at the time would have been 40-50,000 copies in my territory, I literally sold hundreds of thousands of copies of JURASSIC PARK. It was incredible. I've never approached that number again. The success of this book changed the way publishers and authors looked at movies as a vehicle to sell books; it was truly an event. It's also the reason why I recommend it.<br><br>--Ron Lundquist, Ballantine Sales Rep.</p><h2>Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America</h2><p><p><b>A gripping, in-depth account of the 2016 presidential election that explains Donald Trump&#x2019;s historic victory</b></p><p>Donald Trump&#x2019;s election victory stunned the world. How did he pull it off? Was it his appeal to alienated voters in the battleground states? Was it Hillary Clinton and the scandals associated with her long career in politics? Were key factors already in place before the nominees were even chosen? <i>Identity Crisis</i> provides a gripping account of the campaign that appeared to break all the political rules&#x2015;but in fact didn&#x2019;t.</p><p><i>Identity Crisis</i> takes readers from the bruising primaries to an election night whose outcome defied the predictions of the pollsters and pundits. The book shows how fundamental characteristics of the nation and its politics&#x2015;the state of the economy, the Obama presidency, and the demographics of the political parties&#x2015;combined with the candidates&#x2019; personalities and rhetoric to produce one of the most unexpected presidencies in history. Early on, the fundamental characteristics predicted an extremely close election. And even though Trump&#x2019;s many controversies helped Clinton maintain a comfortable lead for most of the campaign, the prediction of a close election became reality when Americans cast their votes.</p><p><i>Identity Crisis</i> reveals how Trump&#x2019;s victory was foreshadowed by changes in the Democratic and Republican coalitions that were driven by people&#x2019;s racial and ethnic identities. The campaign then reinforced and exacerbated those cleavages as it focused on issues related to race, immigration, and religion. The result was an epic battle not just for the White House but about what America is and should be.</p></p><p><b>John Sides</b> is professor of political science at George Washington University. <b>Michael Tesler</b> is associate professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine.

Colour theories are outlined, but the main emphasis is on the way contemporary artists actually use colour. The book&#39;s thesis is that once artists have become acquainted with fundamental colour principles, they can begin to have fun with colour and play with it spontaneously. A number of approaches to colour are set forth as a guide, including building a picture with colour blocks, enriching colour with shadows, heightening colour intensity, achieving freshness with broken colour, painting with sunlight, experimenting with abstract colour systems, fantasizing with colour and creating space with colour. Each of the sections of this book are illustrated by the work of artists of historical importance as well as by the work of contemporary artists.

Reprint.</p><p>John Douglas has become the leading expert on criminal personality profiling and the pioneer of modern criminal investigative analysis during his remarkable twenty-five-year career with the FBI. He conducted the first organized study into the methods and motivations of serial criminals and has aided police departments and prosecutors throughout the world. A veteran of the Air Force, he is the author of numerous articles and presentations on criminology and the coauthor of the landmark books <i>Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives and Crime Classification Manual.</i> He has been called upon to analyze violent crimes from those of the Unabomber to the Nicole Brown Simpson-Ron Goldman and JonBenet Ramsey murders. John Douglas and Mark Olshaker coauthored <i>Mindhunter: Inside the FBl's Elite Serial Crime Unit; Unabomber: On the Trail of America's Most-Wanted Serial Killer;</i> and <i>Journey into Darkness.</i> He lives in the Washington, D.C., area.A look at rape-and-murder and its perpetrators by one of the men who invented the forensic art of psychological profiling. Douglas (Mindhunter, also with Olshaker, not reviewed, etc.) was the founder and longtime head of the FBI's Investigative Support Unit and over his career saw many cases that went unsolved, including the Green River Killer, a case so frustrating that it nearly killed Douglas himself. Douglas's readers will be familiar with this assortment of famously grisly scenes combined with profiles of the murderers. This book focuses mainly on stalkers and their victims, so Douglas necessarily revisits the scenes of Rebecca Schaffer, Dominique Dunne, and Teresa Saldana. He also gives an overview of rapists/murderers such as Ted Bundy and Gary Heidnik, the City of Brotherly Love's answer to Jeffrey Dahmer. Unfortunately, much of the information here is already so familiar to crime buffs that there isn't much to be gleaned from these sections. Douglas is much better at the beginning, when he discusses a little-known killer who seems to have been the basis for Francis Dolarhyde in Red Dragon (Thomas Harris fans, take note). Douglas's profile of this stalker and killer is illuminating, unlike too much of this book, which is merely titillating. The promise of the subtitle goes unfulfilled--the ``fighting back'' seems limited to victim's families joining support groups, rather than any real advice to those seeking protection from a stalker. In fact, most of these victims had restraining orders against their stalkers, which were of little use in the face of a knife or a gun. Not much more than a collection of truly horrifying stories, which is a shame for both the reader, who justifiably expects more, and for Douglas, who has more to offer.

Soon enough, though, paradise gained becomes paradise lost, and--even for a wistful visionary like Puttermesser--the problem of disappointment remains unresolved.</p><p>Fans of Cynthia Ozick are likely already familiar with Ruth Puttermesser, whose highly educated, unlucky-in-love but rather mystical existence as a Jewish woman in New York City has been chronicled in previously published stories appearing occasionally through the years. <i>The Puttermesser Papers</i> collects the old stories, along with several new ones, combined to create a funny and surreal picaresque narrative, touching upon Puttermesser's job at a blueblood law firm, her creation and intellectual sparring with the golem she makes out of soil from her flowerpots, her term as mayor of New York, her own death by murder, and beyond.Cynthia Ozick&#39;s books inlcude What Henry James Knew, Portrait of the Artist as a Bad Character and The Shawl. Her essays, novels and short stories have won numerous prizes and awards, including the American Academy of Arts and Letters Straus Living Award, four O.

When Grandpa explains to Benny that God, not him, should be thanked for the wonderful bagels, Benny sets out to do just that. He decides to leave God a bagful of bagels in the synagogue at the end of each week. And each week God eats the bagels --- or so Benny thinks ... <br><br>Lovingly told, Bagels from Benny explores the values of caring and sharing, building a strong sense of community and finding joy in giving thanks.</p><p>Benny adores helping out his Grandpa at the bagel bakery, the best in town. The young Jewish boy loves his grandfather's bagels so much, he wants to thank God for them. But how? One morning, he asks his Grandpa if he could pay him for his work with a big bag of bagels. So equipped, he heads for the synagogue, takes a deep breath, opens the big wooden cupboard that is the Holy Ark, and places the steaming bag inside: "King of the Universe," he whispered. "I brought You some bagels. I know You make them. But You never taste them, because Grandpa sells every last one." Benny keeps this up week after week until he discovers, to his dismay, that a poor man in a tattered coat has been eating his bagels, and not God. How will God know he is thanking Him if someone else is eating the bagels? Grandpa reassures him that by making the world better, he is indeed thanking God. Dusan Petricic's expressive, cross-hatched illustrations, each one as round and warm and brown as a freshly baked bagel, illuminate all of the story's best moments with humor and emotion. This simple, touching Jewish folktale from Spain transcends Judaism as a story of human kindness and generosity of spirit that will resonate with all children. <i>--Karin Snelson</i>2003 Sydney Taylor Book Award, winner, younger readers category 2004 National Jewish Book Award, shortlist 2004 Society of School Librarians International Book Awards, honor book</p><h2>Twilight / New Moon / Eclipse / Breaking Dawn</h2><p>Twilight is a series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels by American author Stephenie Meyer.

The prince smiled at the motion and placed his mouth to the old man&#x2019;s ear, feeling the heat of his skin on his lips. As he spoke his voice changed, as if another man were there. &#x201c;It has started, my father,&#x201d; he whispered in a soft, evil hiss. &#x201c;There is no turning back. You might as well lift your hand to stop the sunrise as to bring an end to this plan. Like your own death, it is inevitable. A new day is dawning, a day of secret alliances and powerful men, an age of dark miracles, dreadful rumors and a red sinking moon, a day of a bright flash on the horizon that does not come from the sun. It will be an age of power and oppression far greater than has ever fallen on the earth. Even as I whisper to you, Father, even as my breath touches your ears, the great battle has started. The sun is setting on the frail world you have known. It is passing, and with its passing, the greater kingdom shall come. A world poised at the brink of a disastrous war is unaware of the evil forces that will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. But in the midst of turmoil and impending doom, some of the Father&#x2019;s most valiant servants are in place &#x2013; sons and daughters who may have the power to change the course of history.

Then we're got to make sure we're all speaking the same language. This part's the easiest.<br><br>Here we go! On these two pages you'll find just about everything you'll need to get you started. One of the nice things about being a comicbook artist is the fact that your equipment is no big deal. Let's just give the various items a fast once-over...<br><br><b>Pencil.</b> Some artists prefer a soft lead, some like the finer hard lead. It's up to you.<br><br><b>Pen.</b> A simple drawing pen with a thin point, for inking and bordering.<br><br><b>Brush.</b> Also for inking. A sable hair #3 is your best bet.<br><br><b>Erasers.</b> One art gum and one smooth kneaded eraser -- which is cleaner to use.<br><br><b>India ink.</b> Any good brand of black india ink is okay.<br><br><b>White opaquing paint.</b> Invaluable for covering errors in inking.<br><br><b>A glass Jar.</b> This holds the water for cleaning your brushes.<br><br><b>Pushpins.</b> Handy for keeping your illustration paper from slipping off the drawing board.<br><br><b>Triangle.</b> A must for drawing right angles and working in perspective.<br><br><b>T square.</b> Invaluable for drawing borders and keeping lines parallel.<br><br><b>Ruler.</b> For everyone who says "1 can't draw a straight line without a ruler." Now you've no excuse!<br><br><b>Illustration paper.</b> We use 2-ply Bristol board, large enough to accommodate artwork 10" x 15".<br><br><b>Drawing board.</b> This can be a drawing table or merely a flat board which you hold on your lap. Either way, you always need some such thing upon which to rest your sheet of illustration paper.<br><br><b>Rag.</b> This plain ol' hunk of any kind of cloth is used to wipe your pen points, brushes, and whatever. The sloppier you are, the more you'll need it.<br><br><b>Ink compass.</b> Well, how else are you gonna draw circles? While you're at it, you might as well get a pencil compass, too-even though Johnny forgot to draw one for you.<br><br>Of course, there are some things we omitted, like a chair to sit on and a light so that you can see what you're doing in case you work in the dark. Also, it's a good idea to have a room to work in-otherwise your pages can get all messy in the rain. But we figured you'd know all this.<br><br>And now, onward!<br><br>Just to make sure we all use the same language and there's no misunderstanding when we refer to things, let's review the various names for many of the elements that make up a typical comicbook page.<br><br><b>A.</b> The first page of a story, with a large introductory illustration, is called the <b>splash page.</b><br><br><b>B:</b> Letters drawn in outline, with space for color to be added, are called <b>open letters.</b><br><br><b>C:</b> Copy which relates to a title is called a <b>blurb.</b><br><br><b>D:</b> The name of the story is, of course, the <b>title.</b><br><br><b>E:</b> An outline around lettering done in this jagged shape is called a <b>splash balloon.</b><br><br><b>F:</b> A single illustration on a page is called a <b>panel.</b><br><br><b>G:</b> The space between panels is called the <b>gutter.</b><br><br><b>H:</b> You won't be surprised to know that this <b>"ZAT"</b> is a <b>sound effect.</b><br><br><b>I:</b> Copy which represents what a character is thinking is a <b>thought balloon.</b><br><br><b>J:</b> The little connecting circles on thought balloons are called <b>bubbles.</b> (We'd feel silly calling them "squares"!)<br><br><b>K:</b> The regular speech indicators are called <b>dialogue balloons.</b><br><br><b>L:</b> The connecting "arrows" on dialogue balloons, showing who is speaking, are called <b>pointers.</b><br><br><b>M:</b> The words in balloons which are lettered heavier than the other words are referred to as <b>bold words,</b> or <b>bold lettering.</b><br><br><b>N:</b> This is my favorite part-where the names are. We call it the <b>credits,</b> just like in the movies.<br><br><b>O:</b> All this little technical stuff, showing who publishes the mag and when and where, usually found on the bottom of the first page, is the <b>indicia</b> (pronounced <i>in-deeï¿½ -shah).</i><br><br><b>P:</b> Copy in which someone is talking to the reader, but which is not within dialogue balloons, is called a <b>caption.</b><br><br>Chances are we left out a few other things, but this is all we can think of right now. However, not to worry; we'll fill you in on anything else that comes up as we keep zooming along.<br><br>Movin' right along, we now introduce you to one of Marvel's many widely heralded <b>close-ups,</b> so called because the "camera" (meaning the reader's eye) has moved in about as close as possible.<br><br>This type of panel, in which the reader's view of the scene is from farther away, enabling him to see the figures from head to toe, is called a <b>medium shot.</b><br><br>And here we have a <b>long shot.</b> In fact, since it shows such an extreme wide-angle scene, you might even call it a <b>panoramic long shot</b> without anyone getting angry at you.<br><br>When you're up above the scene, looking down at it, as in this panel, what else could you possibly call it but a <b>bird's-eye view?</b><br><br>On the other hand, when you're below the scene of action, as in this panel, where your eye, level is somewhere near Spidey's heel, we're inclined to refer to it as a <b>worm's-eye view.</b><br><br>A drawing in which the details are obscured by solid black (or any other single tone or color) is called a <b>silhouette.</b> And now that we agree upon the language, let's get back to drawing the pictures...<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 1978 by Stan Lee and John Buscema</p><h2>If The Legends Fade</h2><p>&#34;All things shall pass.

Each of these thirteen original stories offers a fresh and unique take on what birthdays mean to the undead. From Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse attending a birthday party for Dracula to Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden battling bloodsucking party crashers, these suspenseful, surprising, sometimes dark, sometimes humorous stories will ensure paranormal fans will never think of vampires or birthdays quite the same again.</p><p>Charlaine Harris writes the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling paranormal series featuring Sookie Stackhouse (the basis for the HBO series <i>True Blood</i>) and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling mystery series featuring lightning-struck corpse locator Harper Connelly. <br><br> Toni L.P. Kelner is the award-winning author of the Laura Fleming Southern mystery series.This patchwork anthology of 13 new vampire stories proves that heavyweight contributors can give some substance to a relatively slight theme. Harris (the Sookie Stackhouse novels), Kelner (the Laura Fleming mysteries) and 11 other writers with serious vamp credentials craft stories around the concept of birthdays for bloodsuckers. Most of the tales only blow out candles in passing, as with P.N. Elrod's Grave-Robbed, which mixes pathos and comedy as vampire PI Jack Fleming busts a phony medium mid-sï¿½ance, and Tanya Huff's Blood Wrapped, in which Henry Fitzroy's search for the ideal gift for a vampire's 40th mixes with his pursuit of a human kidnapper. Christopher Golden takes birthdays to heart in his poignant coming-of-age story, The Mournful Cry of Owls, while Kelley Armstrong proposes in Twilight that a vampire's real birthday is the date of transformation from mortal to immortal. Fans of the many series vampires on parade here will be undeterred by the variable quality of their adventures. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charles Bukowski (1920&#x2013;1994), one of the most outrageous figures of twentieth-century American literature, was so prolific that many significant pieces never found their way into his books. <em>Absence of the Hero</em> contains much of his earliest fiction, unseen in decades, as well as a number of previously unpublished stories and essays. The classic Bukowskian obsessions are here: sex, booze, and gambling, along with trenchant analysis of what he calls "Playing and Being the Pet." Among the book's highlights are tales of his infamous public readings ("The Big Dope Reading," "I Just Write Poetry So I Can Go to Bed with Girls"); a review of his own first book; hilarious installments of his newspaper column, <em>Notes of a Dirty Old Man</em>, including meditations on neo-Nazis and driving in Los Angeles; and an uncharacteristic tale of getting lost in the Utah woods ("Bukowski Takes a Trip"). Yet the book also showcases the other Bukowski&#x2014;an astute if offbeat literary critic. From his own "Manifesto" to his account of poetry in Los Angeles ("A Foreword to These Poets") to idiosyncratic evaluations of Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, LeRoi Jones, and Louis Zukofsky, <em>Absence of the Hero</em> reveals the intellectual hidden beneath the gruff exterior.</p><br><p>Our second volume of his uncollected prose, <em>Absence of the Hero</em> is a major addition to the Bukowski canon, essential for fans, yet suitable for new readers as an introduction to the wide range of his work.</p><br><p>"He loads his head full of coal and diamonds shoot out of his finger tips. What a trick. The mole genius has left us with another digest. It's a full house&#x2014;read 'em and weep."&#x2014;<strong>Tom Waits</strong></p><br><p>"This second volume of Bukowski's uncollected stories and essays offers all that Bukowski is known for&#x2014;wry obscenity, smutty wisdom, seeming ramblings whose hidden smarts catch you unaware&#x2014;but in addition there are moments here in which he takes off the mask and strips away the bravado to show himself at his most vulnerable and human. A must for Bukowski aficionados."&#x2014;<strong>Brian Evenson</strong>, author of <em>Last Days and The Open Curtain</em></p><br><p>"Like a brass-rail Existentialist or a skid-row Transcendentalist, [Bukowski] is candid, unblinking, leaving it to his readers to cast their own judgment about his mishaps, his drinking, his sexual appetite or his own pessimism. He is Ralph Waldo Emerson as a Dirty Old Man, not lounging in the grape-arbor of Concord, Massachusetts, but bent-over a table in an L.A. flophouse scribbling in pencil to the strains of Sibelius."&#x2014;<strong>Paul Maher Jr.</strong>, <em>Phawker</em></p><br><p>"[Bukowski] could be generous and mean-spirited, heroic and defensive, spot-on and slanted, but he became the world-class writer he had set out to be; he has joined the permanent anti-canon or shadow-canon whose denizens had shown him the way. Today the frequent allusions to him in both popular and mainstream culture tend more to respect than mockery. If scholarship has lagged, this book would indicate that this situation is changing."&#x2014;<strong>Gerald Locklin</strong>, <em>Resources for American Literary Study</em></p><br><p>"The pieces range over nearly half a century, and include a story about a baseball player seized by a sudden bout of existential paralysis, along with early, graphically sexual (and masterfully comic) stories published in such smut mags as Candid Press."&#x2014;<strong><em>Penthouse</em></strong></p></p><p><br><p>Charles Bukowski was born in Andernach, Germany in 1920 and brought to Los Angeles at age three. Using the city as a backdrop for his work, Bukowski wrote prolifically, publishing over fifty volumes of poetry and prose. He died in San Pedro, California on March 9, 1994. His books are widely translated and posthumous volumes continue to appear.</p><br><p>David Calonne is the editor of a previous book of uncollected Bukowski, <em>Portions from a Wine-Stained Notebook</em>, as well as a volume of interviews, <em>Charles Bukowski: Sunshine Here I Am</em>. He presently teaches at East Michigan University.</p><br><br><p>"Charles Bukowski, the late poet best known for his odes to sex, booze and general skid-row squalor, turns reflective in much of <em>Absence of the Hero: Uncollected Stories and Essays, Vol. 2: 1946-1992</em>. In one piece, titled "He Beats His Women," Bukowski touches on a visit to these parts: 'The only time I read in San Francisco, 800 people arrived and 100 of those arrived with buckets of garbage to throw at me. At 2 bucks a head, that garbage didn't smell too bad.'"&#x2014;<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></p><br><p>"When Bukowski sat down at his trusted Underwood typewriter to 'play the piano,' it was the only time in his life he felt immortal, with every word painstakingly chosen and direct from the gut. If you haven't had the pleasure of digging into one of his already published works, these easily digestible stories are a perfect starting point."&#x2014;Johnson Cummins, <em>The Montreal Mirror</em></p><br><p>"Even after he published more than 50 books, Bukowski (1920-1994) left behind dozens of unpublished stories and essays. U.S. American literature scholar Calonne, who also edited Vol. 1 of Bukowski's unpublished works, provides an informative and informed introduction and a useful set of notes."&#x2014;<em>The Toronto Globe and Mail</em></p><br><p>"But unlike 'Exit to Brooklyn' and other erotically charged American tales of urban horror and desperation, many of Bukowski's short stories actually leave one with a warm glow, whether from reluctant but real love, brilliant delineation of sociological phenomena in America or, once in a while, juicy science fiction."&#x2014;Adam Perry, <em>Boulder Weekly</em></p><br><p>"Charles Bukowski, prophet of the lost, deacon of the mean and insane...In <em>Absence of the Hero</em>, City Lights' second posthumous volume of uncollected stories and essays, we're given samples spanning almost his entire career. There are moments of brilliance and flickers of light..."&#x2014;<em>Chico News and Review</em></p><br><p>"City Lights take their Bukowski uncollected stories and essays seriously and David Calonne has meticulously assembled and documented the two volumes of this series...this is essential reading for every Bukophile."&#x2014;<em>Bold Monkey</em></p><br><p>"[Bukowski] seems to be one of those rare writers who learns not by emulating a given model but by reading his own stuff as he writes and rediscovering for himself the dignity of form...A low-life raconteur and a dimestore perv, Bukowski was the life of the party night after night. When you open any of his books, that party goes on."&#x2014;Said Shirazi, <em>Fifth Wednesday Journal</em></p><br></p><h2>Hard Rain (John Rain)</h2><p>Trying to end his career as an assassin-for-hire, Japanese-American John Rain goes underground only to be approached by nemesis and Japanese FBI agent Tatsu to eliminate a sociopathic killer who could tip the balance of power in Japan towards the mafia. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Barry Eisler's half-breed freelance assassin John Rain returns to Tokyo for a second outing in <i>Hard Rain</i>, the sequel to Eisler's stunning 2002 debut, <i>Rain Fall</i>. Once again Rain is working with, or at least parallel to, Tatsu, a wily veteran of Japan's FBI equivalent, who aims to cleanse the Japanese government of its systemic corruption. To further this goal, he's persuaded the ever-cautious Rain to take out Murakami, a brutal gangster and hitman who specializes in making his killings look like suicide, a specialty Rain thought was his alone. Liquidating the dangerous and elusive Murakami proves to be a difficult task, however, one that leads to personal loss for Rain, and sets the plot on course for a climax that hits with the power of a well-delivered roundhouse kick.<p> Eisler builds on Rain's self-enforced isolation and loneliness as he expertly shows the reader Tokyo as channeled by Chandler, transforming the burgeoning metropolis into a noir catacomb of dimly lit hostess bars, scheming bureaucrats, shadowy intelligence agents, and outlaw martial arts <i>dojos</i> where thugged-up <i>yakuza</i> train for illicit death matches.</p><p> While the plot becomes complicated toward the novel's conclusion, Rain is a refreshing and complex character whom readers will want to see return for another installment. If you've a yen for a thriller that mixes suspense, intrigue, and action with a Japanese flavor and a hardboiled American attitude, Eisler's <i>Hard Rain</i> is an excellent choice. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p><p><b>Introduction to the New Edition</b></p><p>Having just finished rereading and slightly revising <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> exactly ten years after first writing it, I'm struck by two things. First, how well the book has held up. Part of the credit for this goes to Tokyo, where the story is largely set -- a city whose face is constantly changing but whose essence never does. I lived there again in 2008 and 2009, fifteen years after my first sojourn in Rain's city, and I loved that despite the new surface contours, despite the loss of a few <i>A Lonely Resurrection</i> locales and changes to some others, the feeling of the place was exactly as I remembered. I expect it always will be.</p><p>The second thing that struck me was the prescience of the plot in light of the nuclear catastrophe that followed the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011. I tend to get my plot ideas from real-world occurrences, and here are a few that appear in the book:</p><p><i>Universal Studios Japan, it turned out, had been serving food that was nine months past its due date and falsifying labels to hide it, while operating a drinking fountain pumping out untreated industrial water. Mister Donut was in the habit of fortifying its wares with meat dumplings containing banned additives. Snow Brand Food liked to save a few yen by recycling old milk and failing to clean factory pipes. Couldn't cover that one up -- fifteen-thousand people were poisoned. Mitsubishi Motors and Bridgestone got nailed hard, concealing defects in cars and tires to avoid safety recalls. The worst, shocking even by Japanese standards, was the news that TEPCO, Tokyo Electric Power, had been caught submitting falsified nuclear safety reports going back twenty years. The reports failed to list serious problems at eight different reactors, including cracks in concrete containment shrouds...</i></p><p>I wrote that in 2002. I had access only to open-source materials. The potential for calamity was visible to anyone who wanted to see it. As, indeed, my character Tatsu did:</p><p><i>He pulled himself up and sat on the edge of the tub to take a break from the heat. "You know, Rain-san," he said, "societies are like organisms, and no organism is invulnerable to disease. What matters is whether an organism can mount an effective defense when it finds itself under attack. In Japan, the virus of corruption has attacked the immune system itself, like a societal form of AIDS. Consequently, the body has lost its ability to defend itself. This is what I mean when I say that all countries have problems, but only Japan has problems it has lost the ability to solve. The TEPCO managers resign, but the men charged with regulating their activities for all those years remain? Only in Japan..."</i></p><p><i>He wiped his brow. "So. Consider this state of affairs from Yamaoto's perspective. He understands that, with the immune system suppressed, there must eventually be a catastrophic failure of the host. There have been so many near misses -- financial, ecological, nuclear -- it is only a matter of time before a true cataclysm occurs. Perhaps a nuclear accident that irradiates an entire city. Or a countrywide run on banks and loss of deposits. Whatever it is, it will finally be of sufficient magnitude to shake Japan's voters from their apathy..."</i></p><p>It remains to be seen whether the corruption and collusion that led to Japan's nuclear nightmare will be enough to shake voters from their apathy. I might have been mistaken about that. And I obviously was mistaken in suggesting that Japanese apathy in the face of extraordinary corruption is somehow unique. The last decade in America has seen a war sold to the public on false pretenses, high officials confessing to ordering torture in violation of treaty and domestic law, and an economic meltdown even former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledges involved massive fraud -- and no one has been prosecuted, no one has gone to prison, and Americans continue to dutifully cast their votes for the Democratic/Republican duopoly responsible for these disasters.</p><p>A last thought: it's not just the politics in these books that subsequent events keep validating; it's also the technology. In <i>A Lonely Resurrection,</i> Tatsu tracks Rain to Osaka using a nationwide system of video cameras tied to advanced facial recognition software. Here's what's going on in Japan today, ten years later:</p><p>yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T121128004400.htm</p><p>So despite the presence of the odd anachronistic pager or two, I think on balance A Lonely Resurrection has proven itself not only stalwart, but indeed not-so-surprisingly ahead of its time. See for yourself -- and I hope you'll enjoy it.</p></p><h2>For All the Tea in China: How England Stole the World&#39;s Favorite Drink and Changed History</h2><p><b>A dramatic historical narrative of the man who stole the secret of tea from China </b> <br><br> In 1848, the British East India Company, having lost its monopoly on the tea trade, engaged Robert Fortune, a Scottish gardener, botanist, and plant hunter, to make a clandestine trip into the interior of China&#x2014;territory forbidden to foreigners&#x2014;to steal the closely guarded secrets of tea horticulture and manufacturing. <i>For All the Tea in China</i> is the remarkable account of Fortune's journeys into China&#x2014;a thrilling narrative that combines history, geography, botany, natural science, and old-fashioned adventure. <br><br> Disguised in Mandarin robes, Fortune ventured deep into the country, confronting pirates, hostile climate, and his own untrustworthy men as he made his way to the epicenter of tea production, the remote Wu Yi Shan hills.

Successive generations of U.S. military officers have considered this book an indispensable part of their education.T. R. Fehrenbach&#39;s narrative brings to life the harrowing and bloody battles that were fought up and down the Korean Peninsula. Partly drawn from official records, operations journals, and histories, it is based largely on the compelling personal narratives of the small-unit commanders and their troops. Unlike any other work on the Korean War, it provides a clear panoramic view, sharp insight into the successes and failures of U.S. forces, and a riveting account of fierce clashes between U.N. troops and the North Korean and Chinese communist invaders.The lessons that Colonel Fehrenbach identifies still resonate. Severe peacetime budget cuts after World War II left the U.S. military a shadow of its former self. The terrible lesson of Korea was that to send into action troops trained for nothing but &#34;serving a hitch&#34; in some quiet billet was an almost criminal act. Throwing these ill-trained and poorly equipped troops into the heat of battle resulted in the war&#39;s early routs. The United States was simply unprepared for war. As we enter a new century with Americans and North Koreans continuing to face each other across the 38th parallel, we would do well to remember the price we paid during the Korean War.</p><p>T.R. Fehrenbach commanded Army units in Korea at platoon, company, and battalion levels. Fehrenbach lives in San Antonio, Texas."The author has chosen to alternate the broad view of events on the Korean and international scene with narratives of the contemporaneous experiences of individual soldiers at the front and in rear echelons," said LJ's reviewer (LJ 1/15/63). Fehrenbach's assessment is frank and often unflattering to America's abilities and the motivation of the common soldier.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Elegy for Eddie LP (Maisie Dobbs, 9)</h2><p>In this latest entry in Jacqueline Winspear&#x2019;s acclaimed, bestselling mystery series&#x2014;&#x201c;less whodunits than why-dunits, more P.D.

(c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineGrade 5-8--Borgel is something of a junior Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Crown, 1980) . One day an old man with 32 black valises shows up on Melvin's doorstep, claiming to to be a relative from the "Old Country." He also says that he is 111 years old. His name is Borgel, and he takes Melvin and the family dog, Fafner, on a trip in his 1937 car into the far reaches of time and through space, which is like an elliptically shaped bagel with poppy seeds. There they meet an Anthropoid Bloboform who runs a cosmic root-beer stand and a Grivnizold who has disguised himself as a human. Their trip in time and space turns into a quest for the great Popsicle, which leads to a trip to the far side of Hell, approached, of course, from Good Intentions Boulevard. The zany tongue-in-cheek humor that typifies Pinkwater's books abounds here. Plot and characterization take a backseat to a strange and constant outpouring of comic occurrences. The improbable and the hilariously absurd occur on almost every page. Such nonstop nuttiness will not appeal to a wide audience, but fans of this particular brand of deadpan humor will delight in Pinkwater's latest offering. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>St. Bartholomew&#39;s Eve, A Tale of the Huguenot Wars (Works of G.

These 12 tales, drawn from his 40-year career, have all the fast-moving plots, outrageous alien characters and general fun of the genre without the purple prose and pretentious pseudoscience. Some of the stories here are little more than page turners, well written and entertaining but slight. Others, like "The Streets of Ashkelon," "Roommates" (the basis for the movie Soylent Green ) and "Brave Newer World," explore serious issues in thoughtful and original ways. Harrison's concerns about overpopulation and the environment sound surprisingly timely now, considering how long ago some of these pieces were written. Refreshingly, with the exception of a few strident moments in "Brave Newer World," Harrison never becomes preachy or lets the message get in the way of a good yarn. Despite its title, the collection contains only one story about Slippery Jim DiGriz, the Stainless Steel Rat. Readers familiar with Harrison's previous DiGriz novels ( Deathworld , et al.) will find the plot twists rather predictable, but these tales are worth reading nonetheless. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Thirteen tales, including one that's previously unpublished, spanning the nearly 40-year career of this Dublin-resident American writer/editor/artist--though the theme or basis for selection (if any) isn't clear. The best of the bunch: in a humorous vein, an interstellar repairman must fix a galactic navigation beacon that alien natives have appropriated as their high temple; an injured water-breathing alien dies in a peasant village on the Adriatic coast, ironically within just a few miles of modern medical treatment and scientific expertise; and a well-dramatized, cogently argued yarn discusses the hidden dangers of eugenics. Also on the agenda: magazines that cruelly target the elderly, toys as a spur to research, military ideology, a spinoff from the Deathworld series, Stonehenge, printing, religion as a destructive force, alien contact, the story of the novel of the movie Soylent Green, and a new yarn featuring Harrison's most famous creation, the picaresque Stainless Steel Rat.

Johnson: Portrait of a President</h2><p>Robert Dallek's brilliant two-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson has received an avalanche of praise. Michael Beschloss, in <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, said that it "succeeds brilliantly." <em>The New York Times</em> called it "rock solid" and <em>The Washington Post</em> hailed it as "invaluable." And Sidney Blumenthal in <em>The Boston Globe</em> wrote that it was "dense with astonishing incidents." <br> Now Dallek has condensed his two-volume masterpiece into what is surely the finest one-volume biography of Johnson available. Based on years of research in over 450 manuscript collections and oral histories, as well as numerous personal interviews, this biography follows Johnson, the "human dynamo," from the Texas hill country to the White House. We see LBJ, in the House and the Senate, whirl his way through sixteen- and eighteen-hour days, talking, urging, demanding, reaching for influence and power, in an uncommonly successful congressional career. Then, in the White House, we see Johnson as the visionary leader who worked his will on Congress like no president before or since, enacting a range of crucial legislation, from Medicare and environmental protection to the most significant advances in civil rights for black Americans ever achieved. And we see the depth of Johnson's private anguish as he became increasingly ensnared in Vietnam.<br> In these pages Johnson emerges as a man of towering intensity and anguished insecurity, of grandiose ambition and grave self-doubt, a man who was brilliant, crude, intimidating, compassionate, overbearing, driven: "A tornado in pants." Gracefully written and delicately balanced, this singular biography reveals both the greatness and the tangled complexities of one of the most extravagant characters ever to step onto the presidential stage.</p><p><br><strong>Robert Dallek</strong> is Professor of History at Boston University. He is the author of the definitive study, <em>Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy</em>, which received the Bancroft Prize in American History, and the best-selling <em>An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963</em>. A frequent commentator on radio and TV, he lives in Washington, D.C.<br>Until Robert Caro completes his multivolume opus, Dallek's two-volume LBJ biography is the best one available. Dallek's work reflects impressive detachment toward a figure about whom few were neutral, least of all LBJ himself. He inherited an elevated sense of self, according to Dallek, who describes the Johnson family's relatively high place on the local social ladder despite their poverty. But LBJ's ego was strangely fragile and self-pitying, and in the conclusion, Dallek questions, after narrating the fateful decisions to escalate the Vietnam conflict, Johnson's "capacity to make rational life and death decisions." He lived and conducted politics as a personal enterprise, as Dallek's account of LBJ's wheeling-and-dealing rise from congressional aide to president illustrates. On the un-seamy side, Dallek credits LBJ's personal experience with poverty as a motive in his championing the social and civil rights enactments of the 1960s. In Dallek's hands, Johnson is complex, deceitful, and idealistic, and the author shows why the man's legacy, both positive and negative, will always command interest and debate. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Even as he delves into philosophic and aesthetic questions, Robert Gutman keeps in sight, clearly and firmly, the composer and his works. He discusses the major genres in which Mozart worked-chamber music; liturgical, theater, and keyboard compositions; concerto; symphony; opera; and oratorio. All of these riches unfold within the framework of the composer's brief but remarkable life. With Gutman's informed and sensitive handling, Mozart emerges in a light more luminous than in previous renderings. The composer was an affectionate and generous man to family and friends, self-deprecating, witty, winsome, but also an austere moralist, incisive and purposeful. Mozart is both an extraordinary portrait of a man in his time and a brilliant distillation of musical thought.<br></p><p>Readers who think of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) as the shrieking vulgarian depicted in Peter Shaffer's hit play (and movie) <i>Amadeus</i> will be astonished by the man they meet in this biography by music historian Robert Gutman: "affectionate and generous ... an austere moralist of vital force, incisiveness, and strength of purpose." Without scanting Mozart's often maladroit handling of his patrons or his earthy way with words ("Let the whole company of patricians lick my ass," he declared in a 1777 letter), Gutman portrays a musical genius who slowly and painfully achieved personal maturity as he emerged from the shadow of his domineering father. The rich cultural life of 18th-century Europe forms a vivid background for Mozart's professional and artistic evolution. And Gutman's descriptions of Mozart's work are models of music writing for the lay reader: they capture the brilliance and beauty of the great composer's art in easily accessible language, as in the analysis of <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>'s place in "a new aesthetic of surging movement ... the vocal and orchestral lines twine, separate, and reunite in confrontation, opposition, and accommodation, an ever-changing, effortless interlacing." The prose delineating Mozart's complex personality is just as full-bodied and perceptive. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Robert W. Gutman is the author of the critically acclaimed biography <i>Richard Wagner</i>. Gutman was one of the founders and directors of the Master Classes at Bayreuth Festival, where he lectured on Wagner. He was a member of the faculty of the State University of New York, and has taught at The City College of New York, The New School for Social Research, Bard College, and Duchesne College.</p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction: First Annual Collection</h2><p>This collection&nbsp;launched the popular and long-running "The Year's Best Science Fiction" series:&nbsp;Fantastic Science Fiction!&nbsp;The Year's Best -- And Biggest Collection&nbsp;Here's the cream of the crop: short stories, novelettes, novellas by science fiction writers already famous and awarded for their high-quality work in science fiction.&nbsp; Writers like:&nbsp;Poul AndersonJoe HaldemanTanith LeeGeorge R.R.

This book first appeared as a lengthy fictitious &#34;excerpt&#34;-written by Vonnegut, but attributed to Trout-in Vonnegut&#39;s God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (1965). With Vonnegut&#39;s permission, Farmer expanded the fragment into an entire standalone novel (including, as an in-joke, a scene that incorporates all of Vonnegut&#39;s original text). Farmer&#39;s story was first published in two parts beginning in the December 1974 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The plot, in which Earth is destroyed by cosmic bureaucrats doing routine maintenance and the sole human survivor goes on a quest to find the &#34;Definitive Answer to the Ultimate Question,&#34; was paid homage by the later Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy series.</p><p></p><h2>Born to heal;: The astonishing story of Mr. A and the ancient art of healing with life energies</h2><p>The astonishing story of Mr. A and the remarkable cures he achieves through the ancient are of healing with life energies</p><p>In my spare time, I am a massage therapist, so, I was especially interested in reading this book.

This was not my intention. I meant to grow flowers out of the ground, like any normal person would. But I&#x2019;ve never been normal, and magic is unpredictable, finicky, and dangerous, especially in the wrong hands.<br><br> Granny had taught me magic from the cradle. Some grandmothers shower their grandbabies with cuddles and kisses and gumdrops. I got enchantments and spells and potions. Granny knew spells to conjure rain and wind, charms to make things grow or shrink, and enchantments of disguise and trickery. She could brew a potion to clear your mind or clear your stuffy nose. She had elixirs for toothaches, bellyaches, and heartaches, and a special balm for bottom itch. There was no end to the wonders of magic.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was also no end to the troubles.<br><br> When I was five years old, I wanted to grow red roses for Granny&#x2019;s birthday. Roses, because her name is Rose, and red, because my name is Red. They would be the per- fect gift. I knew I could do it. I had seen Granny grow fat orange pumpkins and juicy red berries straight out of the ground with just a wave of her hands and a few words.<br><br> I chose my own words with care.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Red Rose Charm</b><br> Sprout and blossom, red, red <br> rose Let your fragrance fill <br> my nose<br> &nbsp;<br> I felt the tingle of the magic in my fingertips. I gave a flourish of the arm, a flick of the hand, just as Granny did, but nothing happened. I tried again. I spoke louder, flourished grander, and...<br><br> A red rose exploded out of my right nostril.<br><br> I tried to rub the rose off, but that only made me sneeze, and another rose shot out of my left nostril.<br><br> Granny could not stop laughing. You might even say she cackled.<br><br> &#x201c;Granny! Do some-ding!&#x201d; I sobbed through the roses. I expected her to wave her hands and make the roses disappear. Instead, she ripped them right out of my nose.<br><br> &#x201c;Aaaaouch!&#x201d; I screamed.<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you for the roses,&#x201d; said Granny, placing them in a vase on her table. &#x201c;We can call them booger blossoms.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Achoo!&#x201d; I replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> Granny laughed for a full five minutes. I sneezed for five hours.<br><br> I&#x2019;ll admit, it was sort of funny, even if it did hurt worse than pixie bites. But I worried that this might be an omen&#x2014;that the magic was somehow wrong inside me. After the booger blossoms, I decided to stick to practical magic, such as a drying spell. I&#x2019;d seen Granny do this countless times: just a snap of her fingers and she&#x2019;d have dripping laundry dry in minutes.<br><br> But when I snapped my fingers, no wind came. Just fire. Yes, fire, as in flames. Flaming skirts and blouses and undergarments. In less than a minute, they were cinders and ash.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re certainly dry,&#x201d; said Granny.<br><br> When I was six, I had a friend named Gertie. We were only allowed to play at her house with constant supervision from her mother, Helga. Helga was always worried. She worried Gertie would fall in a well or off a cliff. She worried Gertie would choke on her morning mush. She worried trolls would come in the night and carry Gertie away for their supper. This worrying became problematic when I wanted to take Gertie into The Woods to play.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother says I&#x2019;ll be eaten by wolves,&#x201d; Gertie said. <br><br> &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been eaten by wolves, and I play in The Woods all the time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you ever get lost? Mother is always afraid I&#x2019;ll lose my way.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m never lost. I have a magic path.&#x201d; Gertie&#x2019;s eyes got as big as apples. Magic was rare, and my path was something special. It only appeared when I wanted it to, and it led me wherever I wanted to go in The Woods. Surely this would entice Gertie to come with me, but it didn&#x2019;t. She stepped away from me. Her eyes grew wary.<br><br> &#x201c;Mother says magic is dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My path isn&#x2019;t dangerous,&#x201d; I said with indignation. &#x201c;Granny made it to keep me safe. She made it grow right out of the ground after a bear attacked me and I almost died.&#x201d; I thought this would impress her. The possibility of death was always exciting, and being able to defy it with magic was even better.<br><br> &#x201c;Mother says your granny is a witch,&#x201d; said Gertie.<br><br> Of course Granny was a witch. I knew that, but Gertie said it like it was a bad thing. Desperation took hold of me. I really wanted to play with Gertie in The Woods. So I did the only sensible thing I could think of. I cast the Worrywart Spell on Gertie&#x2019;s mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Worrywart Spell</b><br> Worry&#x2019;s a wart upon your chin<br>It spreads and grows from deep within<br>Make the wart shrink day by day <br> Send your worries far away<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, the spell did nothing to cure Helga&#x2019;s worries. Instead, she grew a wart on her chin. The wart grew steadily bigger, day by day, until Granny was summoned to remedy my mistake. Needless to say, I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to play with Gertie anymore&#x2014;or anyone else&#x2014;for, in addition to being a worrywart, Helga was also the village gossip. The news spread all over The Mountain.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a witch,&#x201d; Helga told the villagers, &#x201c;just like her grandmother.&#x201d; She seemed to forget it was Granny who had cured her.<br><br> Gertie stopped talking to me, and no one else would even look at me. The magic in me grew hot and sticky. It coated my throat. It stung my eyes. I wished I could swallow it down and make it disappear.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Red,&#x201d; Granny told me. &#x201c;We all make mistakes. When I was your age, I tried to summon a rabbit to be my pet, and instead I called a bear to the door!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;How did you survive?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The bear was actually quite nice. My sister married him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She married a bear?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. He wasn&#x2019;t really a bear. He was a prince under a spell.&#x201d;<br><br> This did nothing to alleviate my concerns. I didn&#x2019;t want to marry a bear or a prince.<br> &#x201c;All the magic I do is bad,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;Nonsense, child,&#x201d; said Granny. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re only mistakes. It takes a hundred miles of mistakes before you arrive at your own true magic.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But what if my mistakes are too big?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No such thing, dear,&#x201d; said Granny.<br><br> But she was wrong. I went on trying spells and charms and potions, and I went on making mistakes. Big ones. Small ones. Deadly ones.<br><br> My last mistake was worse than warts, fire, or roses out the nose.</p><h2>Truth About Nutrition - Paperback</h2><p>Dr. Wallach&#39;s newest book &#34;Truth About Nutrition&#34; is a clear and simple way to learn the ways to live younger, longer.

Even with the starlight and the feeble seepage from the streetlamps around the corner, my eyes took longer to adjust than I expected. <br>The police officer at the bottom of the Arch Street alley looked up at me quizzically as I hesitated beside my car, my hands burrowing deep inside my pockets. &#x201c;You okay, Lieutenant?&#x201d; He was stringing a yellow &#x201c;Police Line&#x201d; tape across the way. <br>I shuddered and nodded, walking down the paved incline, careful of its neglected, broken surface. &#x201c;Sure, Bobby. Still half asleep.&#x201d; <br>He lifted the tape to let me pass. &#x201c;Know what you mean. I been on nights for a week already. Still can&#x2019;t get used to it.&#x201d; <br>He was fresh from the academy, eager and curious, and if statistics were any guide, either destined to learn the ropes with us, and then enter the private sector, disillusioned and bored, or angle a job with the state police, assuming he passed their scrutiny. <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s here already?&#x201d; I asked him. <br>&#x201c;Detectives Klesczewski and Tyler. Officer Lavoie&#x2019;s with them. Sheila Kelly&#x2019;s closing the other end off.&#x201d; <br>I smiled at his titling everyone except Sheila. It wasn&#x2019;t sexist. She&#x2019;d been his supervisor, before we&#x2019;d let him loose on his own. She was the reverse of the trend, ten years with the Burlington PD, come to us in search of a slightly mellower pace. Bobby looked to her as a kid might to an older sister. <br>I continued to the corner, where the Main Street buildings above and behind me showed their backs to the train tracks and the Connecticut River beyond. Typical of many old, red-brick New England towns, Brattleboro, Vermont faced away from the serenity and beauty of the river, having chosen well over a hundred-and-fifty years ago to regard both it and the railroad paralleling it as unsightly commercial conduits. In its heyday, this stretch of ground, unseen by the gentry, had been a coarse and bustling string of loading docks and receiving bays, feeding businesses two floors above, whose windows had glittered with the primped and polished end results. <br>Now the area was forlorn and ignored, a parking place for dumpsters, the homeless, and for teenagers seeking illicit time alone. High overhead, out of sight in the gloom, dotting the curved, fortress-like wall following the river&#x2019;s bend, were hundreds of dingy rear apartments, an increasing number of which were being transformed into tastefully renovated lofts or rendered by the town&#x2019;s excess of psychologists and therapists into peaceful, sunlit havens-drawn to the very scenery that their predecessors had ignored. Most, however, still belonged to the marginally solvent-welfare dwellers holed up in small, dark, cluttered dens, surrounded by commerce, and benefiting from none of it. <br>With theatrical abruptness, a tripod-mounted halogen lamp burst the darkness ahead of me with a brief electrical hiss. It was facing away from me, down and across the tracks, so the effect wasn&#x2019;t blinding, but more fancifully melodramatic. Its harsh light destroyed any subtlety or nuance, revealing everything in its arc in angular, brittle starkness &#x2013; while consigning everything outside it to simple nonexistence. The soiled, damaged brick walls; the cinder-stained gravel of the railroad bed; the parallel crescent of gleaming tracks, and the flat black slab of river water beyond &#x2015; were all briefly frozen in that initial flash of light, like a startled, disheveled partygoer caught in the glare of an instant camera. And just as quickly, it all became mere background to the item at center stage-and the reason for our gathering in the middle of a freezing January night. <br>Perpendicular to the outermost track, his feet toward the river, lay a man in a thick, long, dirty coat. He had no head or hands-they&#x2019;d all been resting on the track when the last train had passed by, and what was left of them didn&#x2019;t merit much description. But they lent the scene its one source of bright color, and to the entire picture a grim sense of purpose. <br>Standing over the body was Ron Klesczewski, that night&#x2019;s detective on call. J. P. Tyler, our forensics man, had just plugged in the lamp. <br>He moved away from its glare and joined me in the darkness, like a technician stepping offstage to check his work. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see calling the paramedics. Got hold of everybody else-the ME, the SA&#x2019;s office, more backup. Gail not on tonight?&#x201d; <br>Gail Zigman was a deputy state&#x2019;s attorney, and the woman I lived with. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I answered. &#x201c;I forgot to ask who was when I left.&#x201d; I gestured with my chin down the tracks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;ve we got?&#x201d; <br>Tyler shrugged. &#x201c;Little early to tell, and I don&#x2019;t want to do too much before the ME gets here, but it looks like a bum who ran out of rope.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Suicide?&#x201d; I asked mildly. <br>&#x201c;Probably. Although you don&#x2019;t usually find them with their hands on the track.&#x201d; <br>Before moving any closer, I said, more to myself than to him, &#x201c;Unless he was already dead.&#x201d;</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>Air Apparent (Xanth #31)</h2><p><br><br>When the Good Magician Humfrey's son Hugo suddenly vanishes, his disappearance sets in motion a series of madcap misadventures that send a collection of colorful characters on a perilous pair of parallel quests.

She was fifty-five years old chronologically, thirty-three physically, and her thyme was starting to wilt. If they waited much longer, the storks would never deliver to her, regardless of any spell. This time the signal would go out. She knew that Hugo was eager to send that signal, and so was she.<br>Where was he? He had gone to the cellar to fetch a celebratory bottle of Rhed Whine. That should have taken no more than ten minutes, and he would hardly have dawdled. Something was wrong.<br>Wira got off the bed, donned a nightrobe and slippers, and made her way out of their chamber. She pattered down the familiar stairs to the ground floor, and thence to the cellar. She knew every crevice of the castle, of course, and made no misstep.<br>But as she reached the cellar floor, she experienced a faint tinge of uneasiness. Her magic talent was Sensitivity, and though it normally applied to people, plants, and animals, it could sometimes attune to situations. This situation was uncomfortable.<br>&#x201c;Hugo?&#x201d; she called tentatively.<br>There was no answer.<br>The tinge became less faint. In fact it intensified into a wary semblance of dread.<br>&#x201c;Hugo, where are you?&#x201d; she called less tentatively.<br>There was a definitely untentative silence.<br>Something was wrong. Not only was Hugo absent, there was something else in the cellar. She smelled its misty essence.<br>She snapped her fingers. Little magic echoes bounced off the cellar walls and floor, verifying its dimensions. Except for a muffled place on the floor, the vague shape of a man lying down.<br>Had Hugo fainted? But this wasn&#x2019;t Hugo. The shape was vaguely wrong, and of course the smell.<br>She squatted and reached forward to touch it. Her fingers encountered a clammy kind of flesh. It was definitely not quite alive.<br>Wira screamed.<br>The Gorgon, Humfrey&#x2019;s Designated Wife of the Month, and coincidentally also Hugo&#x2019;s mother, was the first to respond. &#x201c;Wira, dear,&#x201d; she called from the head of the cellar stairs. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? Are you hurt?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Mother Gorgon, there&#x2019;s a dead man here, and I think he&#x2019;s not quite human. And Hugo is gone.&#x201d;<br>There was half a pause. &#x201c;This bears investigation. Let me fetch a lamp.&#x201d;<br>Wira waited by the body while the Gorgon got the lamp. Wira did not need light, of course, as she was blind. She had always been that way, and really did not mind it as long as she was in familiar territory. But others had some kind of problem with darkness.<br>She heard the returning footsteps, smelled the curling vapors of the lamp, and felt its slight warmth. There was also the faint sibilance of a small nest of snakes. The Gorgon was back and ready to take charge.<br>Wira had always gotten along well with the Gorgon. That was partly because the Gorgon&#x2019;s face tended to turn others to stone, but Wira could not see it, so was not at risk. That enabled them to be friends without precautions. The Gorgon was actually a very nice person, but strangers tended to be prejudiced by her magic face, and were nervous about her snake hair. The snakes were normally friendly, and could be good company on a dull day.<br>&#x201c;It is definitely a body,&#x201d; the Gorgon said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not breathing and it&#x2019;s cold, so it must be at least halfway dead. But who killed it, and what is it doing here?&#x201d;<br>Wira had a horrible thought. &#x201c;Oh Mother Gorgon, you don&#x2019;t suppose Hugo could have&#x2014;have&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not, dear. Hugo doesn&#x2019;t have a murderous bone in his body. Not even a stiff one, as far as anyone knows. When are you two going to signal the stork?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tonight,&#x201d; Wira said, blushing. Sometimes the Gorgon&#x2019;s language was a trifle serpentine. But she had reason: her sister the Siren was long since a grandmother. She seemed to have forgotten about the stork-hiding spell.<br>Now the Gorgon had a nasty thought. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t suppose he could have gotten cold feet, or whatever?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never,&#x201d; Wira said positively. &#x201c;He wanted to&#x2014;to do it. To be a father.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon sighed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so young.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mother, he&#x2019;s forty-three.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br>Wira didn&#x2019;t argue the case. Technically she was a dozen years older than Hugo, but she had been youthened to sweet sixteen to marry him, so seemed a decade younger. Mothers always thought their sons were too young. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t have left without word to me. Especially not tonight. Something must have happened to him.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon was focusing on the body. &#x201c;I have another foul thought. Maybe somebody killed this poor man, dumped the body here, and abducted Hugo to frame him for the murder. That would explain everything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Except where Hugo is, and who the victim is, and who the real murderer is,&#x201d; Wira agreed.<br>&#x201c;Yes, there may be a detail or three to fill out. We&#x2019;d better get Humfrey in on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s nighttime,&#x201d; Wira protested. &#x201c;He gets grumpy when disturbed at night.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He gets grumpy any time,&#x201d; the Gorgon said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t see much of it because you have an ameliorative effect on him. I think if he&#x2019;d been half a century younger he would have married you himself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mother Gorgon!&#x201d; Wira exclaimed, horrified.<br>&#x201c;Oh come on now, girl. You know he&#x2019;s taken with you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m his daughter-in-law.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That, too. Anyway, he already has about five wives too many; he certainly doesn&#x2019;t need any more. Now I&#x2019;m going to get him up, grumpy or not, and bring him down here to fathom the situation. It will give him another pretext to bury himself in the Book of Answers.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I hope the Answer is there!&#x201d; Wira breathed. &#x201c;I miss Hugo so much!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s been gone only half an hour, dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, and it&#x2019;s awful.&#x201d;<br>The Gorgon gazed at her. Wira could tell when someone was looking at her; there was a certain subtle mood. &#x201c;You really do love him, don&#x2019;t you, dear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that is why I am taken with you, Wira. Without you he&#x2019;s pretty much a rotten-fruited gnome.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is not!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not, dear,&#x201d; the Gorgon agreed, smiling knowingly. Wira could also tell when a person was smiling; it curled up the corners of the voice. Then the Gorgon went off to roust out the Good Magician.<br>Wira remained in the cellar, uncertain what else to do. She knew the Gorgon meant well, but the woman sometimes unnerved her. Meanwhile, there was this awful situation to deal with. Could someone really have tried to frame Hugo for the murder? To make it seem that he had committed a terrible crime, and fled the scene? But how could such a thing have been done here, in the Good Magician&#x2019;s Castle? The castle was enchanted to exclude all but the most powerful magic.<br>Yet something of the sort had happened. That was frightening in itself.<br>She checked the shelves along the cellar wall, just in case there was some indication that would help resolve the mystery. She knew the stored potions by the shapes of their bottles and faint odors. The first shelf held bottles of pills from pharm-assist plants that a pill pusher had harvested for the Good Magician long ago. The pills lent certain temporary talents to those who swallowed them. There were gra-pills that enabled folk to wrestle well, purr-pills that caused folk to turn reddish blue while feeling very satisfied, and ap-pills that kept doctors away. Also princi-pills for those lacking in ethics, sim-pills for those with too much intellect, and pill-fur coats for those who didn&#x2019;t mind stealing clothing. All was in order, undisturbed.<br>The next shelf contained assorted gloves or mitts reserved for particular Challenges: an amity, which made a person very friendly; an enmity, which had the opposite effect; a hermit, which was a solitary lady&#x2019;s glove; an imitate that enabled a person to copy things; a comity that made the wearer courteous; an emit that caused a stink; an omit that somehow had been left off the list; a submit that could be used underwater; a permit that allowed almost anything; and an admit that added a glove and also let a person into the castle. At the end of the shelf was a vomit that she knew better than to touch. None had been disturbed. The problem seemed to be confined to the (ugh) body.<br>&#x201c;Ludicrous, woman,&#x201d; Humfrey&#x2019;s voice came grumpily from above. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t it wait until morning?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do you want poor Wira to stay in the cellar all night?&#x201d; the Gorgon&#x2019;s voice retorted.<br>Wira had to smile, wanly. The Gorgon was using her to make Humfrey mind. It was true that the Good Magician liked her, though Wira was sure it was not in the way the Gorgon had implied. Wira was sensitive to his moods, and so could manage him to an ex...<br><br></p><h2>The Faith of Fallen Jews: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and the Writing of Jewish History (The Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)</h2><p>From his first book, From Spanish Court to Italian Ghetto, to his well-known volume on Jewish memory, Zakhor, to his treatment of Sigmund Freud in Freud&#x2019;s Moses, Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi (1932&#x2013;2009) earned recognition as perhaps the greatest Jewish historian of his day, whose scholarship blended vast erudition, unfettered creativity, and lyrical beauty.

Indeed it is in some respects primarily an ideological struggle.&nbsp; Yet it is a war we cannot win without a broader understanding of al-Qaeda's goals and motives. <br><br>What do our enemies believe?&nbsp; What motivates their war against the West?&nbsp; What is their vision of the ideal Islamic society?&nbsp; Surprisingly, more than five years after 9/11, there is very little understanding of these questions.&nbsp; <br><br>Despite our tendency to dismiss Islamic extremism as profoundly irrational, al-Qaeda is not without a coherent body of beliefs.&nbsp; Like other totalitarian movements, the movement&#x2019;s leaders have rationalized their brutality in a number of published treatises.&nbsp; Now, for the first time, <i>The Al Qaeda Reader</i> gathers together the essential texts and documents that trace the origin, history, and evolution of the ideas of al-Qaeda founders Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; <br><br>This extraordinary collection of the key texts of the al-Qaeda movement&#x2014;including incendiary materials never before translated into English&#x2014;lays bare the minds, motives, messages, and ultimate goals of an enemy bent on total victory. Al-Qaeda&#x2019;s chilling ideology calls for a relentless <i>jihad</i> against non-Muslim "infidels," repudiates democracy in favor of Islamic law, stresses the importance of martyrdom, and mocks the notion of "moderate" Islam.<br><br>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of these works is how grounded they are in the traditional sources of Islamic theology: the Koran and the teachings of the Prophet. The founders of al-Qaeda use these sources as powerful weapons of persuasion, reminding followers (and would-be recruits) that Muhammad and his warriors spread Islam through the power of the sword and that the Koran is not merely allegory or history but literal truth that commands all Muslims to action.<br><br>In addition to laying bare al-Qaeda&#x2019;s ultimate motives, <i>The Al Qaeda Reader</i> includes the organization&#x2019;s propagandist speeches, which are directed primarily at Americans, Europeans, and Iraqis. Here, al-Qaeda&#x2019;s many "official" accusations against the West are meticulously delineated, from standard complaints such as the Palestinian issue and Iraq to wholly unexpected ones concerning the U.S.&#x2019;s exploitation of women and the environment.<br><br>Taken together, the Theology and Propaganda sections of this volume reveal the most comprehensive picture of al-Qaeda to date. They also highlight the double-speak of bin Laden and Zawahiri, who often say one thing to Muslims in their religious treatises ("We must hate and fight the West because Islam commands it") and another in their propaganda directed at the West ("The West is the aggressor and we are fighting back merely in self-defense").<br><br>Westerners from across the political spectrum will be fascinated and enlightened by <i>The Al Qaeda Reader</i>&#x2019;s insights into the nature of Islamic texts and the ways in which al-Qaeda has used these texts to manufacture hatred against our civilization and our way of life.</p><p>Raymond Ibrahim is a historian of the Middle East and Islam.

And prayers and peace be upon our Prophet,Muhammad bin Abdullah, who said: &#x201c;I have been sent with the sword between my hands to ensure that no one but Allah is worshipped&#x2013;Allah who put my livelihood under the shadow of my spear and who inflicts humiliation and scorn on those who disobey my commandments.&#x201d;<br><br>Never since Allah made the Arabian Peninsula flat, created its desert, and encircled it with seas has it been stormed by any force like the Crusader hordes that have spread in it like locusts, consuming its wealth and polluting its fertility. All this is happening at a time in which nations are attacking Muslims in unison&#x2013;as if fighting over a plate of food! In face of this critical situation and lack of support, we are all obliged to discuss current events, as well as reach an agreement on how [best] to settle the matter.<br><br>No one argues today about three well-established facts, known to everyone; we enumerate them as a reminder, so that the one remembering may remember.<br><br>1. For over seven years America has been occupying the lands of Islam in its holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula&#x2013;plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead with which it fights the neighboring Muslim peoples.<br><br>While some people may have argued in the past over the realities of the occupation, all the people of the Peninsula now acknowledge it. There is no clearer evidence than America&#x2019;s ceaseless aggression against the Iraqi people&#x2013;all launched right from the Peninsula, though its rulers collectively refuse having their land used for this end. But they have been subdued. <br><br>2. Despite the awful devastation inflicted on the Iraqi people at the hands of the Crusader-Jewish alliance, and despite the astronomical number of deaths&#x2013;which has exceeded 1 million&#x2013;despite all this, the Americans attempt once again to repeat the horrific massacres, as if the protracted sanctions imposed after the brutal war, or the fragmentation and devastation, was not enough for them.<br><br>So now here they come [again] to annihilate what is left of this people and humiliate their Muslim neighbors. [6]<br><br>3. Now if the Americans&#x2019; purposes behind these wars are religious and economic, so too are they also to serve the Jews&#x2019; petty state [Israel], diverting attention from its occupation of Jerusalem and the murder of Muslims there. There is no better evidence of this than their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region&#x2013;such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan&#x2013;into mini&#x2014;paper states, whose disunion and weakness will guarantee Israel&#x2019;s survival and the continuation of the brutal Crusader occupation of the Peninsula. <br><br>All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear declaration of war on Allah, His Messenger, and the Muslims. Ulema throughout Islamic history are unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty whenever the enemy tears into the lands of the Muslims. This was related by Imam bin Qudama in al-Mughni; Imam al-Kisa&#x2019;i in al-Bada&#x2019;i; al-Qurtubi in his commentary; and the Sheikh of Islam [Ibn Taymiyya] in his chronicles, where he states: &#x201c;As for defensive warfare, this is the greatest way to defend sanctity and religion. This is an obligation consensually agreed to [by the ulema]. After faith, there is nothing more sacred than repulsing the enemy who attacks religion and life.&#x201d;<br>On that basis, and in compliance with Allah&#x2019;s order, we hereby issue the following decree to all Muslims: <br><br>The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies&#x2013;civilians and military&#x2013;is an individual obligation incumbent upon every Muslim who can do it and in any country&#x2013;this until the Aqsa Mosque [Jerusalem] and the Holy Mosque [Mecca] are liberated from their grip, and until their armies withdraw from all the lands of Islam, defeated, shattered, and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the Word of the Most High&#x2013;&#x201c;[F]ight the pagans all together as they fight you all together&#x201d; [9:36] and the Word of the Most High, &#x201c;Fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and [all] religion belongs to Allah&#x201d; [8:39].<br><br>And the Most High said: &#x201c;And why should you not fight in the cause of Allah and on behalf of those oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, Lord! Rescue us from this town and its oppressors. Give us from Your Presence some protecting friend! Give us<br>from Your Presence some defender!&#x201d; [4:75].<br><br>By Allah&#x2019;s leave we call upon every Muslim who believes in Allah and wishes to be rewarded to comply with Allah&#x2019;s order to kill the Americans and seize their money wherever and whenever they find them. We also call on Muslim <i>ulema</i>, leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid on the Devil&#x2019;s army&#x2013;the Americans&#x2013;and whoever allies with them from the supporters of Satan, and to rout those behind them so that they may learn [a lesson].<br><br>Allah Most High said: &#x201c;O you who have believed! Respond to Allah and the Messenger whenever He calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah comes between a man and his heart, and that it is He to whom you shall [all] be gathered&#x201d; [8:24].<br><br>Allah Most High said: &#x201c;O you who have believed! What is the matter with you? When you are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, you cling so heavily to the earth! Do you prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, in comparison to the Hereafter. Unless you go forth [and fight], He will punish you with a grievous torment, and put others in your place. But He you cannot harm in the least; for Allah has power over all things&#x201d; [9:38&#x2014;39].<br><br>Allah Most High said: &#x201c;So do not lose heart, nor fall into despair.

He received several awards recognizing his contribution to religious study and contemplation, including the Pax Medal in 1963, and remained a devoted spiritualist and a tireless advocate for social justice until his death in 1968. The Sign of Jonas was originally published in 1953.Fifth, final, and least satisfying volume of Merton's prodigious correspondence (The Courage for Truth, 1993, etc.). Previous books in this series have presented Merton's letters on writing, spirituality, friendship, and love. This time the prime focus is war, a subject about which Merton, a cloistered Cistercian monk, has little original to say. Mostly composed in the years just before and after the Cuban missile crisis, and usually directed toward peace activists like James Forrest or Gordon Zahn, these letters offer predictable mutterings about the dangers of nuclear holocaust, tendentious attacks on American right-wingers, and cracker-barrel advice on the idiocy of fallout shelters (``Lots of shelters that have been built have caved in or filled with water, etc.''). Occasional forays into religious themes reveal him to be a poor prognosticator as well, as when he misreads Vatican II as a ``tightening of the screws.'' More intriguing are letters concerning a meeting in 1956 between Merton and psychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg, who, in the words of editor Shannon, labeled Merton ``neurotic in his need to get his own way and pathological in his demand for solitude.'' This harsh evaluation, which Merton seems to accept (``Zilboorg has been terrific''), is bolstered by letters surrounding Merton's vocational crisis of 1959, in which he applies for permission to leave his monastery for a hermitage. When the request is denied by his superiors, Merton at first accepts the decision but soon begins to agitate; tensions run high until he is allowed to enter a hermitage in the 1960s. In this episode and others, Merton comes off as Peck's Bad Boy, endlessly provoking Vatican officials and siding with mischief-makers. Some compensation for all this ego-preening comes near the end, in correspondence with unidentified monks and nuns to whom Merton offers simple, solid spiritual advice (``be patient, pay attention to obedience and to grace, trust God...'').

In <i>The Invisible Gorilla,</i> Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, creators of one of psychology&#x2019;s most famous experiments, use remarkable stories and counterintuitive scientific findings to demonstrate an important truth: <i>Our minds don&#x2019;t work the way we think they do.</i> We think we see ourselves and the world as they really are, but we&#x2019;re actually missing a whole lot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Chabris and Simons combine the work of other researchers with their own findings on attention, perception, memory, and reasoning to reveal how faulty intuitions often get us into trouble. In the process, they explain:<br>&nbsp;<br>ï¿½ Why a company would spend billions to launch a product that its own analysts know will fail<br>ï¿½ How a police officer could run right past a brutal assault without seeing it<br>ï¿½ Why award-winning movies are full of editing mistakes<br>ï¿½ What criminals have in common with chess masters<br>ï¿½ Why measles and other childhood diseases are making a comeback<br>ï¿½ Why money managers could learn a lot from weather forecasters<br>&nbsp;<br>Again and again, we think we experience and understand the world as it is, but our thoughts are beset by everyday illusions. We write traffic laws and build criminal cases on the assumption that people will notice when something unusual happens right in front of them. We&#x2019;re sure we know where we were on 9/11, falsely believing that vivid memories are seared into our minds with perfect fidelity. And as a society, we spend billions on devices to train our brains because we&#x2019;re continually tempted by the lure of quick fixes and effortless self-improvement. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Invisible Gorilla</i> reveals the myriad ways that our intuitions can deceive us, but it&#x2019;s much more than a catalog of human failings. Chabris and Simons explain why we succumb to these everyday illusions and what we can do to inoculate ourselves against their effects. Ultimately, the book provides a kind of x-ray vision into our own minds, making it possible to pierce the veil of illusions that clouds our thoughts and to think clearly for perhaps the first time.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tom Vanderbilt Reviews <em>The Invisible Gorilla</em></strong> <p><b>Tom Vanderbilt writes on design, technology, architecture, science, and many other topics.

He lives in Brooklyn, NY.</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Do you remember when you first saw--or more likely, didn&#x2019;t see--the gorilla? For me it was one afternoon a number of years ago when I clicked open one of those noxious-but-irresistible forwarded emails ("You Won&#x2019;t Believe Your Eyes!"). The task was simple--count the number of passes in a tight cluster of basketball players--but the ensuing result was astonishing: As I dutifully (and correctly) tracked the number of passes made, a guy in a gorilla suit had strolled into the center, beat his chest, and sauntered off. But I never saw the gorilla. And I was hardly alone.</p> <p>The video, which went on to become a global viral sensation, brought "inattentional blindness"--a once comparatively obscure interest of cognitive psychologists--into striking relief. Here was a dramatic reminder that looking is not necessarily seeing, that &#x201c;paying&#x201d; attention to one thing might come at the cost of missing another altogether. No one was more taken with the experience than the authors of the original study, Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris, as they recount in their new--and, dare I say, eye-opening--book, <i>The Invisible Gorilla</i>. "The fact that people miss things is important," they write, "but what impressed us even more was the surprise people showed when they realized what they had missed."</p> <p><i>The Invisible Gorilla</i> uses that ersatz primate as a departure point (and overarching metaphor) for exploring the myriad of other illusions, perceptual or otherwise, that we encounter in everyday life--and our often complete lack of awareness as we do so. These "gorillas" are lurking everywhere--from the (often false) memories we think we have to the futures we think we can anticipate to the cause-and-effect chains we feel must exist. Writing with authority, clarity, and a healthy dose of skepticism, Simons and Chabris explore why these illusions persist--and, indeed, seem to multiply in the modern world--and how we might work to avoid them. Alas, there are no easy solutions--doing crosswords to stave off cognitive decline in one&#x2019;s dotage may simply make you better at doing crosswords. But looking for those "gorillas in our midst" is as rewarding as actually finding them. </p> (Photo ï¿½ Kate Burton) <br><br>CHRISTOPHER CHABRIS&nbsp;and DANIEL SIMONS&nbsp;are cognitive psychologists who have each received accolades for their research on a wide range of topics. Their &#x201c;Gorillas in Our Midst&#x201d; study reveals the dark side of our ability to pay attention and has quickly become one of the best-known experiments in all of psychology; it inspired a stage play and was even discussed by characters on <i>C.S.I.</i> Chabris, who received his Ph.D. from Harvard, is a psychology professor at Union College in New York.

The uncertainty of thought lies in the fact that it cannot be exchanged either for truth or for reality.<br><br>Jean Baudrillard&#x2019;s now familiar investigations into reality and hyper-reality shift here into a more metaphysical frame. Working his way through the various spheres and systems of everyday life&#x2014;the political, the juridical, the economical, the aesthetic, the biological, among others&#x2014;he finds that they are all characterized by the same non-equivalence, and hence the same eccentricity. Literally, they have no meaning outside themselves and cannot be exchanged for anything. Politics is laden with signs and meanings, but seen from the outside it has no meaning. Schemes for genetic experimentation and investigation are becoming infinitely ramified, and the more ramified they become the more the crucial question is left unanswered: who rules over life, who rules over death? <br><br>Baudrillard&#x2019;s conclusion is that the true formula of contemporary nihilism lies here: the nihilism of value itself. This is our fate, and from this stem both the happiest and the most baleful consequences. This book might be said to be the exploration, first, of the &#x2018;fateful&#x2019; consequences, and subsequently&#x2014;by a poetic transference of situation&#x2014;of the fortunate, happy consequences of impossible exchange.</p><p><b>Jean Baudrillard</b> (1929&#x2013;2007) began teaching sociology at the Universitï¿½ de Paris-X in 1966. He retired from academia in 1987 to write books and travel until his death in 2007. His many works include <i>Simulations and Simulacra</i>, <i>America</i>, <i>The Perfect Crime</i>, <i>The System of Objects</i>, <i>Passwords</i>, <i>The Transparency of Evil</i>, <i>The Spirit of Terrorism</i>, and <i>Fragments</i>, among others.&#x201c;Everything starts out from impossible exchange. The uncertainty of the world lies in the fact that it has no equivalent anywhere; it cannot be exchanged for anything. The uncertainty of thought lies in the fact that it cannot be exchanged either for truth or for reality. Is it the thought which tips the world over into uncertainty, or the other way around? This in itself is part of the uncertainty.&#x201d;&#x2014;</p><h2>The Remedy New Testament Expanded Paraphrase Bible</h2><p>God is love, and love is not self-seeking. (1Jn 4:8, 1Cor 13:5) Love, rather than seeking self, is the principle of beneficence or giving. God, when He built His universe, constructed it to operate upon this principle of giving, an expression of His character of love. Harmony with this principle is life. Disharmony is death. Every breath you take you give away carbon dioxide to the plants which give back oxygen to you, a never ending circle of giving life is built to operate upon. You are free to transgress the law by tying a plastic bag over your head and selfishly hoarding your carbon dioxide to yourself. But, the wages of doing so is death. Thus, the Bible teaches sin is lawlessness and breaking the law results in death. (1Jn 3:4, Rom 6:23) Sadly, after Constantine converted, Christianity changed its view of God&#39;s law from the law of love, the design protocol for life, to an imperial Roman imposed law construct, in which the law has no inherent consequence and thus requires the ruling authority to inflict externally imposed punishments upon lawbreakers. Christianity changed from an organization of people who had such love they would lay down their lives for others (Jn 15:13) to a system that carried out the Crusades, Inquisition and burned dissenters at the stake. Why? God&#39;s design was replaced by an imposed law construct. All Bible translations have been done in the aftermath of Constantine&#39;s conversion and the acceptance of the imposed law construct. This has resulted in unintended misunderstanding of the message of Scripture. The Remedy refocuses our mind upon God&#39;s character of love and His law as the design protocol upon which He constructed life to operate. As such, The Remedy is exactly that, a New Testament paraphrase that communicates God&#39;s remedy for our sin-sick terminal condition. I invite you to partake The Remedy.</p><p></p><h2>Great American wreaths: The best of Martha Stewart living</h2><p>Both a how-to craft book and a decorating guide, Wreaths offers 51 projects for delightful wreaths--complete with step-by-step instructions--honoring the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

He studied medicine in Guadalajara and returned to Lagos in 1909,where he began the practice of his profession. He began his writing career early; in 1896 he published <b>Impressions of a Student</b> in a weekly of Mexico City. This was followed by numerous sketches and short stories, and in 1911 by his first novel, <b>Andres Perez, maderista</b>.</p> <p>Like most of the young Liberals, he supported Francisco I. Madero's uprising, which overthrew the dictatorship of Porfirio Dï¿½az, and in 1911 was made Director of Education of the State of Jalisco. After Madero's assassination, he joined the army of Pancho Villa as doctor, and his knowledge of the Revolution was acquired at firsthand. When the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant, he emigrated to El Paso, Texas, where in 1915 he wrote <b>The Underdogs</b> (<b>Los de abajo</b>), which did not receive general recognition until 1924, when it was hailed as the novel of the Revolution.</p> <p>Azuela was fundamentally a moralist, and his disappointment with the Revolution soon began to manifest itself. He had fought for a better Mexico; but he saw that while the Revolution had corrected certain injustices, it had given rise to others equally deplorable. When he saw the self-servers and the unprincipled turning his hopes for the redemption of the underprivileged of his country into a ladder to serve their own ends, his disillusionment was deep and often bitter. His later novels are marred at times by a savage sarcasm. During his later years, and until his death in 1952, he lived in Mexico City writing and practicing his profession among the poor.</p>Text: Spanish</p><h2>O Come Emmanuel: A Musical Tour of Daily Readings for Advent and Christmas</h2><p>Make Christmas special this year by exploring the legends, message, and theology behind some of your favorite carols and hymns.

I&#39;ll call you soon, Mr. Raccoon.&#34; And many more. In fact, Tortoise spends so long saying good-bye that he never makes it on his adventure. While the concept is cute and the end joke is spot-on, this book suffers from a dissatisfying rhyme scheme that is trying too hard. By the fifth good-bye, the rhymes seem completely forced, and nicknames begin to take precedence over the actual species names. In the end, Levey&#39;s illustrations are the real highlight. Children will likely stick through the story and enjoy pointing out various elements (like how the Rhinoceros is called a Unicorn), but it&#39;s not worth the read-aloud struggle.

The introduction of Kodak&#x2019;s Brownie (the world&#x2019;s first simple, low-cost camera) in 1900 made photography accessible to the masses. Soon everyone had a camera, and snapshots became the most popular means of capturing a time, place, or memory. As the medium became more ubiquitous, so did the variety of cameras available. This remarkable book celebrates the &#x201c;toy camera&#x201d; and its rise out of a novelty market. Inexpensive, often shamelessly marketed to children, and sometimes just plain quirky, these cameras have become a niche industry that thrived during the analog film era and continues to enjoy immense popularity in our digital world. Full-color photographs showcase the most unusual examples of functioning cameras&#x2015;retro analogs, custom pieces, cool new products from Japan, and all sorts of camera-themed objects and accessories&#x2015;and the photographs they create. Interviews with the inventor of the Holga and those responsible for Lomography help explain Game Boy and Batman-themed cameras, and cameras specifically made to photograph cats. Insightful essays explore the role of marketing and hipster culture in these cameras&#x2019; popularity, as well as the newfound enthusiasm for their &#x201c;special&#x201d; effects.</p><p>Christopher D.

He is an award-winning screenwriter.<i>&nbsp;</i>This is his first novel.1<br><br>So, the thing is, I come from the world we were supposed to have.<br><br>That means nothing to you, obviously, because you live here, in the crappy world we do have. But it never should've turned out like this. And it's all my fault-well, me and to a lesser extent my father and, yeah, I guess a little bit Penelope.<br><br>It's hard to know how to start telling this story. But, okay, you know the future that people in the 1950s imagined we'd have? Flying cars, robot maids, food pills, teleportation, jet packs, moving sidewalks, ray guns, hover boards, space vacations, and moon bases. All that dazzling, transformative technology our grandparents were certain was right around the corner. The stuff of world's fairs and pulp science-fiction magazines with titles like Fantastic Future Tales and The Amazing World of Tomorrow. Can you picture it?<br><br>Well, it happened.<br><br>It all happened, more or less exactly as envisioned. I'm not talking about the future. I'm talking about the present. Today, in the year 2016, humanity lives in a techno-utopian paradise of abundance, purpose, and wonder.<br><br>Except we don't. Of course we don't. We live in a world where, sure, there are iPhones and 3D printers and, I don't know, drone strikes or whatever. But it hardly looks like The Jetsons. Except it should. And it did. Until it didn't. But it would have, if I hadn't done what I did. Or, no, hold on, what I will have done.<br><br>I'm sorry, despite receiving the best education available to a citizen of the World of Tomorrow, the grammar of this situation is a bit complicated.<br><br>Maybe the first person is the wrong way to tell this story. Maybe if I take refuge in the third person I'll find some sort of distance or insight or at least peace of mind. It's worth a try.<br><br>2<br><br>Tom Barren wakes up into his own dream.<br><br>Every night, neural scanners map his dreams while he sleeps so that both his conscious and unconscious thought patterns can be effectively modeled. Every morning, the neural scanners transmit the current dream-state data into a program that generates a real-time virtual projection into which he seamlessly rouses. The dream's scattershot plot is made increasingly linear and lucid until a psychologically pleasing resolution is achieved at the moment of full consciousness . . .<br><br>I'm sorry-I can't write like this. It's fake. It's safe.<br><br>The third person is comforting because it's in control, which feels really nice when relating events that were often so out of control. It's like a scientist describing a biological sample seen through a microscope. But I'm not the microscope. I'm the thing on the slide. And I'm not writing this to make myself comfortable. If I wanted comfort, I'd write fiction.<br><br>In fiction, you cohere all these evocative, telling details into a portrait of the world. But in everyday life, you hardly notice any of the little things. You can't. Your brain swoops past it all, especially when it's your own home, a place that feels barely separate from the inside of your mind or the outside of your body.<br><br>When you wake up from a real dream into a virtual one, it's like you're on a raft darting this way and that according to the blurry, impenetrable currents of your unconscious, until you find yourself gliding onto a wide, calm, shallow lake, and the slippery, fraught weirdness dissolves into serene, reassuring clarity. The story wraps up the way it feels like it must, and no matter how unsettling the content, you wake with the rejuvenating solidity of order restored. And that's when you realize you're lying in bed, ready to start the day, with none of that sticky subconscious gristle caught in the cramped folds of your mind.<br><br>It might be what I miss most about where I come from. Because in this world waking up sucks.<br><br>Here, it's like nobody has considered using even the most rudimentary technology to improve the process. Mattresses don't subtly vibrate to keep your muscles loose. Targeted steam valves don't clean your body in slumber. I mean, blankets are made from tufts of plant fiber spun into thread and occasionally stuffed with feathers. Feathers. Like from actual birds. Waking up should be the best moment of your day, your unconscious and conscious minds synchronized and harmonious.<br><br>Getting dressed involves an automated device that cuts and stitches a new outfit every morning, indexed to your personal style and body type. The fabric is made from laser-hardened strands of a light-sensitive liquid polymer that's recycled nightly for daily reuse. For breakfast, a similar system outputs whatever meal you feel like from a nutrient gel mixed with color, flavor, and texture protocols. And if that sounds gross to you, in practice it's indistinguishable from what you think of as real food, except that it's uniquely gauged to your tongue's sensory receptors so it tastes and feels ideal every time. You know that sinking feeling you get when you cut into an avocado, only to find that it's either hard and underripe or brown and bruised under its skin? Well, I didn't know that could even happen until I came here. Every avocado I ever ate was perfect.<br><br>It's weird to be nostalgic for experiences that both did and didn't exist. Like waking up every morning completely refreshed. Something I didn't even realize I could take for granted because it was simply the way things were. But that's the point, of course-the way things were . . . never was.<br><br>What I'm not nostalgic for is that every morning when I woke up and got dressed and ate breakfast in this glittering technological utopia, I was alone.<br><br>3<br><br>On July 11, 1965, Lionel Goettreider invented the future.<br><br>Obviously you've never heard of him. But where I come from, Lionel Goettreider is the most famous, beloved, and respected human on the planet. Every city has dozens of things named after him: streets, buildings, parks, whatever. Every kid knows how to spell his name using the catchy mnemonic tune that goes G-O-E-T-T-R-E-I-D-E-R.<br><br>You have no idea what I'm talking about. But if you were from where I'm from, it'd be as familiar to you as A-B-C.<br><br>Fifty-one years ago, Lionel Goettreider invented a revolutionary way to generate unlimited, robust, absolutely clean energy. His device came to be called the Goettreider Engine. July 11, 1965, was the day he turned it on for the very first time. It made everything possible.<br><br>Imagine that the last five decades happened with no restrictions on energy. No need to dig deeper and deeper into the ground and make the skies dirtier and dirtier. Nuclear became unnecessarily tempestuous. Coal and oil pointlessly murky. Solar and wind and even hydropower became quaint low-fidelity alternatives that nobody bothered with unless they were peculiarly determined to live off the main grid.<br><br>So, how did the Goettreider Engine work?<br><br>How does electricity work? How does a microwave oven work? How does your cell phone or television or remote control work? Do you actually understand on, like, a concrete technical level? If those technologies disappeared, could you reconceive, redesign, and rebuild them from scratch? And, if not, why not? You only use these things pretty much every single day.<br><br>But of course you don't know. Because unless your job's in a related field you don't need to know. They just work, effortlessly, as they were intended to.<br><br>Where I come from, that's how it is with the Goettreider Engine. It was important enough to make Goettreider as recognizable a name as Einstein or Newton or Darwin. But how it functioned, like, technically? I really couldn't tell you.<br><br>Basically, you know how a dam produces energy? Turbines harness the natural propulsion of water flowing downward via gravity to generate electricity. To be clear, that's more or less all I understand about hydroelectric power. Gravity pulls water down, so if you stick a turbine in its path, the water spins it around and somehow makes energy.<br><br>The Goettreider Engine does that with the planet. You know that the Earth spins on its axis and also revolves around the Sun, while the Sun itself moves endlessly through the solar system. Like water through a turbine, the Goettreider Engine harnesses the constant rotation of the planet to create boundless energy. It has something to do with magnetism and gravity and . . . honestly, I don't know-any more than I genuinely understand an alkaline battery or a combustion engine or an incandescent light bulb. They just work.<br><br>So does the Goettreider Engine. It just works.<br><br>Or it did. Before, you know, me.<br><br>4<br><br>I am not a genius. If you've read this far, you're already aware of that fact.<br><br>But my father is a legitimate full-blown genius of the highest order. After finishing his third PhD, Victor Barren spent a few crucial years working in long-range teleportation before founding his own lab to pursue his specific niche field-time travel.<br><br>Even where I come from, time travel was considered more or less impossible. Not because of time, actually, but because of space.<br><br>Here's why every time-travel movie you've ever seen is total bullshit: because the Earth moves.<br><br>You know this. Plus I mentioned it last chapter. The Earth spins all the way around once a day, revolves around the Sun once a year, while the Sun is on its own cosmic route through the solar system, which is itself hurtling through a galaxy that's wandering an epic path through the universe.<br><br>The ground under you is moving, really fast. Along the equator, the Earth rotates at over 1,000 miles per hour, twenty-four hours a day, while orbiting the Sun at a little over 67,000 miles per hour. That's 1,600,000 miles per day. Meanwhile our solar system is in motion relative to the Milky Way galaxy at more than 1,300,000 miles per hour, covering just shy of 32,000,000 miles per day. And so on.<br><br>If you were to travel back in time to yesterday, the Earth would be in a different place in space. Even if you travel back in time one second, the Earth below your feet can move nearly half a kilometer. In one second.<br><br>The reason every movie about time travel is nonsense is that the Earth moves, constantly, always. You travel back one day, you don't end up in the same location-you end up in the gaping vacuum of outer space.<br><br>Marty McFly didn't appear thirty years earlier in his hometown of Hill Valley, California. His tricked-out DeLorean materialized in the endless empty blackness of the cosmos with the Earth approximately 350,000,000,000 miles away. Assuming he didn't immediately lose consciousness from the lack of oxygen, the absence of air pressure would cause all the fluids in his body to bubble, partially evaporate, and freeze. He would be dead in less than a minute.<br><br>The Terminator would probably survive in space because it's an unstoppable robot killing machine, but traveling from 2029 to 1984 would've given Sarah Connor a 525,000,000,000-mile head start.<br><br>Time travel doesn't just require traveling back in time. It also requires traveling back to a pinpoint-specific location in space. Otherwise, just like with regular old everyday teleportation, you could end up stuck inside something.<br><br>Think about where you're sitting right now. Let's say on an olive-green couch. A white ceramic bowl of fake green pears and real brown pinecones propped next to your feet on the teak coffee table. A brushed-steel floor lamp glows over your shoulder. A coarse rug over reclaimed barn-board elm floors that cost too much but look pretty great . . .<br><br>If you were to teleport even a few inches in any direction, your body would be embedded in a solid object. One inch, you're wounded. Two inches, you're maimed. Three inches, you're dead.<br><br>Every second of the day, we're all three inches from being dead.<br><br>Which is why teleportation is safe and effective only if it's between dedicated sites on an exactingly calibrated system.<br><br>My father's early work in teleportation was so important because it helped him understand the mechanics of disincorporating and reincorporating a human body between discrete locations. It's what stymied all previous time-travel initiatives. Reversing the flow of time isn't even that complex. What's outrageously complex is instantaneous space travel with absolute accuracy across potentially billions of miles.<br><br>My father's genius wasn't just about solving both the theoretical and logistic challenges of time travel. It was about recognizing that in this, as in so many other aspects of everyday life, our savior was Lionel Goettreider.<br><br>5<br><br>The first Goettreider Engine was turned on once and never turned off-it's been running without interruption since 2:03 p.m. on Sunday, July 11, 1965.<br><br>Goettreider's original device wasn't designed to harness and emit large-scale amounts of energy. It was an experimental prototype that performed beyond its inventor's most grandiose expectations. But the whole point of a Goettreider Engine is that it never has to be deactivated, just as the planet never stops moving. So, the prototype was left running in the same spot where it was first switched on, in front of a small crowd of sixteen observers in a basement laboratory in section B7 of the San Francisco State Science and Technology Center.<br><br>Where I come from, every schoolkid knows the names and faces of the Sixteen Witnesses. Numerous books have been written about every single one of them, with their presence at this ultimate hinge in history shoved into the chronology of their individual lives as the def ining event, whether or not it was factually true.<br><br>Countless works of art have depicted The Activation of the Goettreider Engine. It's The Last Supper of the modern world, those sixteen faces, each with its own codified reaction. Skeptical. Awed. Distracted. Amused. Jealous. Angry. Thoughtful. Frightened. Detached. Concerned. Excited. Nonchalant. Harried. There's three more. Damn it, I should know this . . .<br><br>When the prototype Engine was first turned on, Goettreider just wanted to verify his calculations and prove his theory wasn't completely misguided-all it had to do was actually work. And it did work, but it had a major defect. It emitted a unique radiation signature, what was later called tau radiation, a nod to how physics uses the Greek capital letter T to represent proper time in relativity equations.<br><br>As the Engine's miraculous energy-generating capacities expanded to power the whole world, the tau radiation signature was eliminated from the large-scale industrial models. But the prototype was left to run, theoretically forever, in Goettreider's lab in San Francisco-now among the most visited museums on the planet-out of respect, nostalgia, and a legally rigid clause in Goettreider's last will and testament.</p><h2>Understanding Girls with AD/HD</h2><p>A ground-breaking book on the needs and issues of girls with attentional problems: why they are often undiagnosed, how they are different from boys, and what their special needs are in school, in their social world and at home. Age-related checklists from pre-school to high school help parents and professionals better identify and help girls with AD/HD.</p><p></p><h2>Jane and the Dragon</h2><p>Jane lives in the royal court and longs to be a knight. No one takes her dreams seriously, except the court jester, who gives Jane his secret suit of armour to practice with. When a dragon comes and steals away the prince, Jane is ready and willing to fight it. Will her dream ever come true?</p><p>Martin Baynton has written and illustrated several books for children. His Jane and the Dragon books inspired an animated TV series first developed in Canada and now airing in the U.S. on ABC, iNetwork, and Telemundo. Martin Baynton also writes for the stage, television, film, and radio. Born in the U.K., he lives in New Zealand.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;Everyone laughs at Jane for wanting to be a knight, except the court jester, who loans her his small suit of armor, and she spends her days practicing knightly duties. When a dragon steals the prince, Jane sets out to rescue him. After a long, wearisome battle, they sit down and talk about what's expected of dragons (stealing the prince) and knights (being men). In the end, she turns an enemy into a friend, returns the prince to his parents, becomes a proper knight with Saturdays off to visit a friend, and dances with the jester at the royal ball. Bathed in a golden light, the whimsical illustrations for this original fairy tale cast a golden glow on Jane's aspirations and adventures. The watery blues and lavenders in the second book are equally fitting and as amusing, as the child and the dragon search for the king's magician, banished from the court because he cannot do a rain spell. Unfortunately, the magician discovers that the missing ingredient is anger, nearly destroying a farming community and Jane's dragon. When the creature is struck by blue lightning and falls into the water below, the youngster saves him and shows the repentant sorcerer that being sorry is only the beginning. Baynton reverses the traditional role of girls in fairy tales and redeems their adversaries. These kindly stories, also an animated TV series, are solid choices.&#x2014;<i>Mary Jean Smith, Southside Elementary School, Lebanon, TN</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter featuring Howard&#39;s seminal sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. Most of the stories were originally published in various fantasy magazines. Conan, now about thirty-one, survives a Turanian trap that crushes his Zuagir raiders and seeks bloody revenge on Vardanes of Zamora, their betrayer. Afterwards he moves on to other adventures, engaging in skull-duggery in the cannibal-haunted city of Zamboula and ultimately gaining command of a band of Kozaki in the service of Kobad Shah, king of Iranistan. In this final adventure he once again encounters his arch-enemy Olgerd Vladislav, his predecessor as chief of the Zuagirs.</p><p></p><h2>AN Essay Concerning Human Understanding</h2><p>This new, complete, and unabridged edition represents the very latest in critical thinking on Locke&#39;s pioneering work, which set the groundwork for modern philosophy.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.An English philosopher, John Locke is the first person to expound the theory of empiricism in a methodical manner.

Invaders threatened on all fronties, but they grew to respect and fear the name of Belisarius, the Emperor Justinian&#39;s greatest general. With this book Robert Graves again demonstrates his command of a vast historical subject, creating a startling and vivid picture of a decadent era.</p><p>Robert Graves was born in 1895 in Wimbledon. He went from school to the First World War, where he became a captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers and was seriously wounded at the Battle of the Somme. He wrote his autobiography, Goodbye to All That, in 1929, and it was soon established as a modern classic. He died on 7 December 1985 in Majorca, his home since 1929.</p><h2>Farewell To The East End by Jennifer Worth (Paperback)</h2><p><p>The last book in the trilogy begun by Jennifer Worth's <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and the basis for the PBS series <em>Call the Midwife</em></p><p>When twenty-two-year-old Jennifer Worth, from a comfortable middle-class upbringing, went to work as a midwife in the poorest section of postwar London, she not only delivered hundreds of babies and touched many lives, she also became the neighborhood's most vivid chronicler. <em>Call the Midwife: Farewell to the East End</em> is the last book in Worth's memoir trilogy, which the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em> described as "powerful stories with sweet charm and controlled outrage" in the face of dire circumstances.</p><p>Here, at last, is the full story of Chummy's delightful courtship and wedding. We also meet Megan'mave, identical twins who share a browbeaten husband, and return to Sister Monica Joan, who is in top eccentric form. As in Worth's first two books, <em>Call the Midwife: A Memoir of Birth, Joy, and Hard Times</em> and <em>Call the Midwife: Shadows of the Workhouse</em>, the vividly portrayed denizens of a postwar East End contend with the trials of extreme poverty&#x2014;unsanitary conditions, hunger, and disease&#x2014;and find surprising ways to thrive in their tightly knit community.</p><p>A rich portrait of a bygone era of comradeship and midwifery populated by unforgettable characters, <em>Call the Midwife: Farewell to the East End</em> will appeal to readers of Frank McCourt, Katherine Boo, and James Herriot, as well as to the fans of the acclaimed PBS show based on the trilogy.</p></p><p><p>Jennifer Worth trained as a nurse at the Royal Berk-shire Hospital in Reading, and was later ward sister at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London, then the Marie Curie Hospital, also in London. Music had always been her passion, and in 1973 she left nursing in order to study music intensively, teaching piano and singing for about twenty-five years. Jennifer died in May 2011 after a short illness, leaving her husband, Philip; two daughters; and three grandchildren. Her books have all been bestsellers in England.</p>&#39;A sad farewell but a memorable and satisfying send-off&#39; DAILY EXPRESS &#39;One would struggle to find a better descrption of a long-gone era and its heartening, forgotten values&#39; SUNDAY BUSINESS POST</p><h2>Suttree (Modern Library)</h2><p>By the author of <b>Blood Meridian</b> and <b>All the Pretty Horses</b>, <b>Suttree</b> is the story of Cornelius Suttree, who has forsaken a life of privilege with his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River near Knoxville.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining on the margins of the outcast community there--a brilliantly imagined collection of eccentrics, criminals, and squatters--he rises above the physical and human squalor with detachment, humor, and dignity.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Suttree</i> contains a humour that is Faulknerian in its gentle wryness, and a freakish imaginative flair reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> (London)<br><br>&#x201c;All of McCarthy&#x2019;s books present the reviewer with the same welcome difficulty. They are so good that one can hardly say how good they really are. . . . <i>Suttree</i> may be his magnum opus. Its protagonist, Cornelius Suttree, has forsaken his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat among the inhabitants of the demimonde along the banks of the Tennessee River. His associates are mostly criminals of one sort or another, and Suttree is, to say the least, estranged from what might be called normal society.

He grew up in Richmond, Virginia and now lives in Bethesda, Maryland with his family.The James is America's river. It witnessed the birth of English-speaking America in 1607 and the 'new birth of freedom' ushered in by Union victory in the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln's dramatic visit to the fallen Confederate capital of Richmond on April 4, 1865. Bob Deans' eloquent narrative does full justice to the story both tragic and majestic of this historic river. (James M.

With the eye of a fine journalist and the heart of a native Virginian, Bob Deans has made an engaging human drama of the great river's history, from Pocahontas and John Smith to Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln. It's a compelling read. (Doyle McManus, Washington Bureau Chief, Los Angeles Times)<br><br>A waterway that runs through Virginia also runs through&#x2014;and nourishes&#x2014;our identity as a nation. This book is the work of a superb journalist, and also a masterful storyteller.

(<i>Time Magazine</i>)<br><br>Deans has written an account of our history that is at once lively, surprising and deeply insightful, a powerful book that reveals much about who Americans are and where we came from.

After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain.<br><br>Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew.<br><br>On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story. In it, Noah Gordon utilizes his greatest strengths, and the result is remarkable and moving.<br><br></p><p><br>Noah Gordon has had outstanding international success, selling in Germany alone more than eight million copies of his recent trilogy (<i>The Physician, Shaman, </i>and <i>Matters of Choice</i>). The Society of American Historians awarded him the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Shaman as the best historical novel of 1991/1992. He was also voted "Novelist of the Year" by the readers of the Bertelsmann Book Club, and twice, in 1992 and 1995, he won the Silver Basque Prize for Spain's bestselling book. An earlier book, <i>The Rabbi</i>, was on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller list for 26 weeks. Noah Gordon lives with his wife in Brookline, Massachusetts.<br><br>Set in Spain under the Inquisition, this latest big historical novel from Gordon (Shaman; The Rabbi) follows the adventures of young Yonah Helkias as he stays true to his Jewish faith, escapes from misadventures and finds love. In Toledo, in 1489, a precious reliquary of a Christian saint, crafted by Yonah's silversmith father, disappears; Yonah's older brother, who was delivering the relic, is found dead; and compassionate physician Bernardo Espina begins to investigate the theft and murder. Meanwhile, the Inquisition starts to target Jews, including conversos like Espina (Jews by birth who have entered the Catholic church). The bulk of the novel takes place three years later, when the deadline for all Jews to leave Spain has arrived. Yonah, aged 13, joins thousands of his co-religionists headed for Spanish borders and ports, but instead of departing, Yonah remains behind. After witnessing Espina's death in an auto-da-f?, Yonah leads a fugitive existence as a farmer, a shepherd, a cathedral laborer, a pot repairer, a seaman and, finally, as an apprentice armorer under the demanding master Manuel Fierro. Delivering armor, he returns to Toledo, where he bargains with his family's persecutors to escape a dangerous rendezvous with relic smugglers. Then Yonah's master is fatally double-crossed; after avenging him, Yonah heads to Saragossa, where Fierro's brother trains him to becomeAlike the heroes of Gordon's The Physician and ShamanAa doctor. Yonah changes his name to Ramon Callico, marries a woman who knows his secret, but never gives up his desire to restore Espina's honor to his son, the stolen relic to the Church or his own soul to Judaism. Gordon has earned an international audience for his impressively documented historical narratives, his compassion for the trials of ?migr?s and his intricate descriptions of Renaissance crafts. Through a crowded landscape of characters and incidents, he illuminates the choices history forces on individualsAand, not incidentally, creates a grand, informative adventure and a completely engaging, unsentimental portrait of a turbulent time.

After interviewing for a position at the art gallery which would exclude Celestine, Ernest leads Celestine through a maze of astutely miniaturized Turners, Monets, da Vincis, etc., of which she finally tires. Straying, Celestine loses Ernest, and the pace of their search for each other becomes frantic until the devoted pair is reunited. Safely at home, Celestine finally expresses her fear that Ernest liked the artwork more than herself; but in his direct and loving way, Ernest reassures her that there is nothing he likes better than her, and she reciprocates. Sparked with vitality, yet tinged with mellow pastel lines, the artwork corresponds to the relationship between the sparkling Celestine and the gentle Ernest.

Both men studied in Paris in the 1920s where they absorbed the work of the French Post Impressionists, Cubists and Surrealists.

His interest in music and theatre led him to study at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. He has written a quantity of poetry, several novels, short stories and plays and three volumes of autobiography. He died in 1989.Hoeller's Garret<br><br>After a mild pulmonary infection, tended too little and too late, had suddenly turned into a severe pneumonia that took its toll of my entire body and laid me up for at least three months at nearby Wels, which has a hospital renowned in the field of so-called internal medicine, I accepted an invitation from Hoeller, a so-called taxidermist in the Aurach valley, not for the end of October, as the doctors urged, but for early in October, as I insisted, and then went on my own so-called responsibility straight to the Aurach valley and to Hoeller's house, without even a detour to visit my parents in Stocket, straight into the so-called Hoeller garret, to begin sifting and perhaps even arranging the literary remains of my friend, who was also a friend of the taxidermist Hoeller, Roithamer, after Roithamer's suicide, I went to work sifting and sorting the papers he had willed to me, consisting of thousands of slips covered with Roithamer's handwriting plus a bulky manuscript entitled "About Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, with special attention to the Cone." The atmosphere in Hoeller's house was still heavy, most of all with the circumstances of Roithamer's suicide, and seemed from the moment of my arrival favorable to my plan of working on Roithamer's papers there, specifically in Hoeller's garret, sifting and sorting Roithamer's papers and even, as I suddenly decided, simultaneously writing my own account of my work on these papers, as I have here begun to do, aided by having been able to move straight into Hoeller's garret without any reservations on Hoeller's part, even though the house had other suitable accommodations, I deliberately moved into that four-by-five-meter garret Roithamer was always so fond of, which was so ideal, especially in his last years, for his purposes, where I could stay as long as I liked, it was all the same to Hoeller, in this house built by the headstrong Hoeller in defiance of every rule of reason and architecture right here in the Aurach gorge, in the garret which Hoeller had designed and built as if for Roithamer's purposes, where Roithamer, after sixteen years in England with me, had spent the final years of his life almost continuously, and even prior to that he had found it convenient to spend at least his nights in the garret, especially while he was building the Cone for his sister in the Kobemausser forest, all the time the Cone was under construction he no longer slept at home in Altensam but always and only in Hoeller's garret, it was simply in every respect the ideal place for him during those last years when he, Roithamer, never went straight home to Altensam from England, but instead went every time to Hoeller's garret, to fortify himself in its simplicity (Hoeller house) for the complexity ahead (Cone), it would not do to go straight to Altensam from England, where each of us, working separately in his own scientific field, had been living in Cambridge all those years, he had to go straight to Hoeller's garret, if he did not follow this rule which had become a cherished habit, the visit to Altensam was a disaster from the start, so he simply could not let himself go directly from England to Altensam and everything connected with Altensam, whenever he had not made the detour via Hoeller's house, to save time, as he himself admitted, it had been a mistake, so he no longer made the experiment of going to Altensam without first stopping at Hoeller's house, in those last years, he never again went home without first visiting Hoeller and Hoeller's family and Hoeller's house, without first moving into Hoeller's garret, to devote himself for two or three days to such reading as he could do only in Hoeller's garret, of subject matter that was not harmful but helpful to him, books and articles he could read neither in Altensam nor in England, and to thinking and writing what he found possible to think and write neither in England nor in Altensam, here I discovered Hegel, he always said, over and over again, it was here that I really delved into Schopenhauer for the first time, here that I could read, for the first time, Goethe's Elective Affinities and The Sentimental Journey, without distraction and with a clear head, it was here, in Hoeller's garret, that I suddenly gained access to ideas to which my mind had been sealed for decades before I came to this garret, access, he wrote, to the most essential ideas, the most important for me, the most necessary to my life, here in Hoeller's garret, he wrote, everything became possible for me, everything that had always been impossible for me outside Hoeller's garret, such as letting myself be guided by my intellectual inclinations and to develop my natural aptitudes accordingly, and to get on with my work, everywhere else I had always been hindered in developing my aptitudes but in Hoeller's garret I could always develop them most consistently, here everything was congenial to my way of thinking, here .1 could always indulge myself in exploring all my intellectual possibilities, here in Hoeller's garret my head, my mind, my whole constitution were suddenly relieved from all the outside world's oppression, the most incredible things were suddenly no longer incredible, the most impossible (thinking!) no longer impossible. It was in Hoeller's garret that he found the conditions necessary and most favorable to thought, for getting the mechanism of his thought going in the most natural, most undistracted way, all he had to do was to come to Hoeller's garret from wherever he might be, and the mechanism worked. Whenever I was in England, he wrote, no matter how I felt, I was always thinking, if only I could be in Hoener's garret now, always when he had reached a dead end in his thinking and in his feelings, if only I could be in Hoeller's garret now, but on the other hand he realized that settling for good in Hoener's garret was not synonymous with always being able to think freely and without distraction, and that, if he could stay forever in Hoeller's garret, it would mean nothing less than his own total destruction, if I stay in Hoener's garret longer than need be, he wrote, I'll be done for in no time at all, that's the end of me, he thought, which is why he had always stayed in Hoeller's garret for only a definite period of time, how long exactly he could never foresee, but it had to be strictly limited, he must have considered a stay of fourteen to fifteen days in the Hoeller garret ideal, as his notes imply, always just fourteen or fifteen days, every time, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, according to Hoeller, Roithamer always packed up in a flash and went off to Altensam, though he did not necessarily stay in Altensam for any length of time very often, but only for the shortest possible time, as little time as he could manage, the absolute, inescapable minimum, no more, he had even been known to take up residence in Hoeller's house with every intention of going on to Altensam after fourteen days or so, but instead of going on to Altensam where he was expected, where his arrival had already been announced, after fourteen or fifteen days, he went from Hoeller's place in the Aurach gorge straight back to England, because his stay at Hoeller's place, in the Hoeller ambience, had not only given him enough, but had actually advanced his thinking so much that he did not need to stop at Altensam but could go straight back to England, specifically Cambridge, where he was always both studying and teaching simultaneously and, as he always kept saying, he never exactly knew at any particular moment whether he was studying or teaching because, as he said, when I was teaching, I was in fact basically studying, and when I was studying, I was basically teaching. Actually I too found the atmosphere in Hoeller's house ideal, I immediately made myself at home in the garret which had been Roithamer's garret and will always remain Roithamer's garret, from the very start I had always intended to take notes on my work with Roithamer's papers and on the entire process involved, and I soon understood how perfect for Roithamer's purposes Hoeller's garret was, how he had settled into Hoeller's garret with its view to westward, pitch-dark it was over the raging Aurach, and to northward, also pitch dark, the water steadily and always noisily slapping and crashing against the wet, glistening rock-face, "rehearsing for AItensam in Hoeller's house" as he called those stays in Hoeller's house, specifically Hoeller's garret, stays that quickly succeeded one another in those last years, especially the last three years, when he went five or six times, for four or five months at a time, from England to Altensam, but actually only to Hoeller's garret, obviously attracted to it by Hoeller's work, those meticulous preservations of animals, and in general by all the curious conditions of the place, so intimately bound up with the play of light in the Aurach valley, where every day ran its course simply enough, but nature was always making itself so powerfully felt, a nature mostly in pain, and all the people there, Hoeller's parents and in-laws and his wife and his still school-age children, for whom everything turned on what game had been shot and gutted, what wildfowl shot and gutted, and all the related chores, all the circumstances of life were bound up with their natural surroundings, it became clear to me that Roithamer had found here in the Aurach gorge as he had nowhere else the inspiration for pressing on with his main task, the building of the Cone, that edifice as a work of art, which he had designed for his sister in three years of incessant mental concentration and which he had built in the following three years with the greatest effort, with what he called almost inhuman energy, built it in the very center of the Kobernausser forest. It was in Hoeller's garret, where I had now moved with Roithamer's papers, most of them relating to the building of the Cone, and I regard my work on Roithamer's papers as the ideal occupational therapy for myself after my long illness and also feel it is ideal, it was here that Roithamer had conceived the idea of the Cone and drawn up the basic plans for it, and the fact that even now, some months after Roithamer's death and half a year after his sister's death, his sister for whom he had built the Cone which is already abandoned to natural decay, Hoeller's garret still contains all the plans, all the books and articles, most of them never used but all of them collected by Roithamer in his last years with a view to building the Cone, all those books and articles in every possible language, including languages unknown to him but translated for him by his brother Johann who spoke many languages and in fact had a gift for languages like no other man I ever knew, the translations were also here in Hoener's garret, and I could see at once that there had to be hundreds of them, stacks of translations from Spanish and Portuguese, as I noticed when I entered the garret, hundreds if not thousands of laborious decipherments of probably important considerations for the construction and completion of the Cone by experts unknown to me but probably familiar to him, he hated the word architect, or architecture, he never said architect, or architecture, and when I or someone else said architect, or architecture, he instantly countered by saying that he could not stand hearing the word architect, or architecture, that these two words were nothing but malformations, verbal monstrosities which no thinking man would stoop to, and I never used the words architect, or architecture, in his presence, nor have I used them since, even Hoeller got accustomed to avoiding the words architect or architecture, like Roithamer we resorted to words such as master builder or building or the art of building; that the word B U I L D is one of the most beautiful in the language, we knew ever since Roithamer had spoken about it, in that same garret where I have now installed myself, one dismal rainy evening when we again, as so often, dreaded the onset of another one of those torrential floods that come tearing down the gorge to devastate the whole area sometimes, though this one receded unexpectedly, those floods in the Aurach gorge would do the most extensive damage but they always spared Hoener's house, all up and down the Aurach they did the most extensive damage but Hoener's house, which was built right into the cleft, was spared always, because Hoeller had known exactly what he was doing, everyone was amazed to see the whole Aurach valley buried in mud, ravaged and destroyed while Hoeller's house alone stood unscathed, incredibly, it was on this dismal rainy evening, with all of us living in fear of another such flood about to bemire and ravage everything in its path, though this time it did not happen, when Roithamer revealed to us the beauty of the word building and the beauty of the word build and the beauty of the phrase builder's masterwork. From time to time he would pick out a word like that, a word that had suddenly become luminous with meaning for him, pick out one word from among all those others, any word at all, and elucidate it to anyone, but usually to those of us who often came in the evening to Hoeller's house and always regularly on those weekends when Roithamer returned from England. Once, as I recall, he spent a whole night analyzing for us the word circumstance, the word condition, and the word consistent. It was touching to find all of Roithamer's books and articles and plans and his writing utensils and thinking aids still right there in Hoeller's garret, just as he had left them. Hoeller's garret was where all the ideas and designs for building the Cone had come into being, here all the ideas had originated, all the plans were sketched, all the necessary decisions for building the Cone had been made here, it was from here Roithamer had directed everything.</p><h2>Elmer and the Dragon</h2><p>&#34;The author has produced a sequel to My Father&#39;s Dragon that is the equal of that first gem in every respect.

In the tradition of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcï¿½a Mï¿½rquez, Lobo Antunes weaves words into an exhilarating tapestry, imbuing his prose with the grace and resonance of poetry. The narrator, freshly returned to Lisbon after his hellish tour of duty in Angola, confesses the traumas of his memory to a nameless lover. Their evening unfolds like a fever dream, as Lobo Antunes leaps deftly back and forth from descriptions of postdictatorship Portugal to the bizarre and brutal world of life on the front line. The result is both tragic and absurd, and belongs among the great war novels of the modern age.</p><p><p><strong>Antï¿½nio Lobo Antunes</strong>, born in 1942 in Benfica, is considered to be Portugal's greatest living writer. The author of more than twenty novels, including <em>What Can I Do When Everything's On Fire?</em>, he has won many awards and makes his home in Lisbon.</p><p>Award-winning translator <strong>Margaret Jull Costa</strong> lives in England.&nbsp;</p>&#x201c;[Antunes] has created a memorably unhinged narrator, and [Costa] manages to capture, perfectly and faithfully, the bitter, hallucinatory and increasingly desperate tone of his monologue.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Larry Rohter, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lobo Antunes crafts macabre fever dreams as if possessed by an abler Poe, and few other novelists have his Bellovian ability to see both deeply and minutely, to render the world, the fallen world, as if never rendered before.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William Giraldi, <em>Daily Beast</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Read Antï¿½nio Lobo Antunes'&nbsp;<em>The Land at the End of the World</em>, and you, like the protagonist, may never forget the hallucinatory depravity, degradation and corruption of an unjust war.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kai Maristed, <em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Magnificent prose, dense with striking and unexpected imagery...I was so seized by the novel's spirit that I was motivated to turn to my own. I wanted to imitate Lobo Antunes, and I failed.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Sympathizer</em></strong></p><h2>Golden Ball and Other Stories (Agatha Christie Mysteries Collection)</h2><p>Is it a gesture of good will or a sinister trap that lures Rupert St. Vincent and his family to magnificent estate? How desperate is Joyce Lambert, a destitute young widow whose only recourse is to marry a man she despises? What unexpected circumstance stirs old loyalties in Theodora Darrell, and unfaithful wife about to run away with her lover? In this collection of short stories, the answers are as unexpected as they are satisfying.

Here, instead, in a memoir of sorts--an inward journey from childhood to ninety--Bloom argues elegiacally with nobody but Bloom, interested only in the influence of the mind upon itself when it absorbs the highest and most enduring imaginative literature. He offers more than eighty meditations on poems and prose that have haunted him since childhood and which he has possessed by memory: from the Psalms and Ecclesiastes to Shakespeare and Dr. Johnson; Spenser and Milton to Wordsworth and Keats; Whitman and Browning to Joyce and Proust; Tolstoy and Yeats to Delmore Schwartz and Amy Clampitt; Blake to Wallace Stevens--and so much more. And though he has written before about some of these authors, these exegeses, written in the winter of his life, are movingly informed by "the freshness of last things."<br><br>As Bloom writes movingly: "One of my concerns throughout <i>Possessed by Memory</i> is with the beloved dead. Most of my good friends in my generation have departed. Their voices are still in my ears. I find that they are woven into what I read. I listen not only for their voices but also for the voice I heard before the world was made. My other concern is religious, in the widest sense. For me poetry and spirituality fuse as a single entity. All my long life I have sought to isolate poetic knowledge. This also involves a knowledge of God and gods. I see imaginative literature as a kind of theurgy in which the divine is summoned, maintained, and augmented."</p><p>Harold Bloom is a Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University and a former Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard. His more than forty books include <i>The Anxiety of Influence</i>, <i>Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human</i>, <i>The Western Canon</i>, <i>The American Religion</i>, and <i>The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime</i>.

He lives in New Haven.<b>Part One: <br><br>A Voice She Heard Before the World Was Made<br></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Thresholds to Voice: Augmenting a God in Ruins</i><br> As I near the end of my eighties, I am aware of being in the elegy season. The majority of my close friends from my own generation have departed. I am haunted by many passages in Wallace Stevens, and one that I keep hearing centers his extraordinary poem, &#x201c;The Course of a Particular&#x201d;:<br><br> And though one says that one is part of everything,<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a conflict, there is a resistance involved;<br> And being part is an exertion that declines:<br> One feels the life of that which gives life as it is.<br> &nbsp;<br> Throughout his final poems, Stevens listens for the voice he heard before the world was made. Though he is not preoccupied with occult and Hermetic modes of speculation, in the manner either of William Butler Yeats or of D. H. Lawrence, he hears voices. Falling leaves cry out, houses laugh, syllables are spoken without speech, the wind breathes a motion, thoughts howl in the mind, the colossal sun sounds a scrawny cry, and the phoenix, mounted on a visionary palm tree, sings a foreign song. Sleepless like many other old men and women, I too dream what Stevens calls a heavy difference:<br><br> A little while of Terra Paradise<br> I dreamed, of autumn rivers, silvas green,<br> Of sanctimonious mountains high in snow,<br> But in that dream a heavy difference<br> Kept waking and a mournful sense sought out,<br> In vain, life&#x2019;s season or death&#x2019;s element.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Montrachet-le-Jardin</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When that saddens me too much, something in my spirit turns to a more intimate Stevens:<br> &nbsp;<br> The cry is part. My solitaria<br> Are the meditations of a central mind.<br> I hear the motions of the spirit and the sound<br> Of what is secret becomes, for me, a voice<br> That is my own voice speaking in my ear.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Chocorua to Its Neighbor</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Frequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in Stevens at his strongest:<br> &nbsp;<br> To say more than human things with human voice,<br> That cannot be; to say human things with more<br> Than human voice, that, also, cannot be;<br> To speak humanly from the height or from the depth<br> Of human things, that is acutest speech.<br> &nbsp;<br> Can human things be said with more than human voice? Stevens was a kind of Lucretian skeptic, as Shelley, Walt Whitman, and Walter Pater had been before him. Yet, of those three, only Pater would have agreed with Stevens as to whether we could hear a primordial utterï¿½ance. Even Stevens had his openings to a transcendental freedom:<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon my top he breathed the pointed dark.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was not man yet he was nothing else.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If in the mind, he vanished, taking there<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mind&#x2019;s own limits, like a tragic thing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without existence, existing everywhere.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> William Butler Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, and, rather more skeptically, Hart Crane all were informed by the ancient tradition of Hermetism, the Greco-Egyptian speculation from which the Renaissance Hermetiï¿½cism developed. In that original speculation, which was inaugurated by a small group of pagan intellectuals in Hellenistic Alexandria during the first century of the Common Era, a story is told of how the first Adam, called Anthropos, is exalted as a divine being. Here is a crucial passage from the Hermetic discourse called &#x201c;The Key&#x201d;:<br> &nbsp;<br> For the human is a godlike living thing, not comparable to the other living things of the earth but to those in heaven above, who are called gods. Or better&#x2014;if one dare tell the truth&#x2014;the one who is really human is above these gods as well, or at least they are wholly equal in power to one another.<br><br> For none of the heavenly gods will go down to earth, leaving behind the bounds of heaven, yet the human rises up to heaven and takes its measure and knows what is in its heights and its depths, and he understands all else exactly and&#x2014;greater than all of this&#x2014;he comes to be on high without leaving earth behind, so enormous is his range. Therefore, we must dare to say that the human on earth is a mortal god but that god in heaven is an immortal human. Through these two, then, cosmos and human, all things exist, but they all exist by action of the one.<br> <i> Translated by Brian P. Copenhaver</i><br> &nbsp;<br> That is Hermetism at its most exalted. Darker is the account that brings together the Fall and the Creation as one event. I turn here to the most famous text of Hermetism, &#x201c;Poimandres,&#x201d; where our primal catastrophe is elegantly chronicled:<br> &nbsp;<br> Having all authority over the cosmos of mortals and unreasoning animals, the man broke through the vault and stooped to look through the cosmic framework, thus displaying to lower nature the fair form of god. Nature smiled for love when she saw him whose fairness brings no surfeit (and) who holds in himself all the energy of the governors and the form of god, for in the water she saw the shape of the man&#x2019;s fairest form and upon the earth its shadow. When the man saw in the water the form like himself as it was in nature, he loved it and wished to inhabit it; wish and action came in the same moment, and he inhabited the unreasonï¿½ing form. Nature took hold of her beloved, hugged him all about and embraced him, for they were lovers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because of this, unlike any other living thing on earth, mankind is twofold&#x2014;in the body mortal but immortal in the essential man. Even though he is immortal and has authority over all things, mankind is affected by mortality because he is subject to fate; thus, although man is above the cosmic framework, he became a slave within it. He is androgyne because he comes from an androgyne father, and he never sleeps because he comes from one who is sleepless. Yet love and sleep are his masters.<br><i> Translated by Brian P. Copenhaver</i><br> &nbsp;<br> In Hart Crane&#x2019;s &#x201c;Voyages II&#x201d; there is a paean to &#x201c;sleep, death, desire,&#x201d; a celebration of the great erotic relationship of the poet&#x2019;s life. Nevertheless, &#x201c;Voyages V&#x201d; admits that the truth of this love is a matter of instants and must end in separation:<br> &nbsp;<br> But now<br> Draw in your head, alone and too tall here.<br> Your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;<br> Your breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:<br> Draw in your head and sleep the long way home.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a kind of gentle resignation in Hart Crane as he confronts erotic loss. Ultimately I think that stems from the Hermetist version of the Fall as a narcissistic reverie that concludes in a catastrophe. Many of us, remembering the now remote erotic attachments of our youth, scores of years back in time, find that involuntarily we remain haunted by a voice we heard emanating from the beloved that seemed timeless and therefore permanent. There is some link that binds together the making of a poem, the illusions of recall, and the tenuous expectation that somehow we will hear again the voice that preceded the instauration of a cosmos forlorn and vagrant, through which we blankly wander, unable to distinguish what was and what we strain to find again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our experience of a lost voice may come to us in solitude or in the presence of others, whether or not they are related to our past sorrows. When I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for me. <br> That vagary could not survive maturation, yet the quest persisted for a voice I had heard before I knew my own alienation. Over the decades I learned to listen closely to my students for some murmurs of those evanescent voices. Since these young men and women are two-thirds of a century younger than I am, I do not seek in their tonalities my own nostalgias. Yet I believe that the teaching of Shakespeare or of <i>Moby-Dick </i>can be an awakening to the ancient Gnostic call that proclaims a resurrection preceding our deaths.<br> &nbsp;<br>In my experience, there are a few visions or surging voices that break through the rock of the self and free something that is both spark and breath, in a momentary knowing that seems to be known even as it knows. When I ask myself who is the knower, I have intimations that a primal sound, cast out of our cosmos and wandering in exile through the interstellar spaces, may be calling to me. There is nothing unique in my experience, as was particularly clear to me in the years 1990&#x2013;92, when I seemed all but endlessly in motion, lecturing at American uniï¿½versities and colleges in the South and Southwest. I accepted speaking engagements only there, when I could get away from Yale, so as to do amateur research listening to people of many sects and persuasions, who I learned to call American Religionists. I recall vividly how many told me they had already been resurrected, and knew they had walked and talked with the Jesus scarcely mentioned in the New Testament, who passed forty days with his faithful after the Ascension.<br><br> At sixty, I both respected and was baffled by so many urgent confesï¿½sions of women and of men that they had touched the flesh of a living Jesus, who walked with them and spoke of everyday matters. Now, in my high eighties, I understand better what was so dark to me a quarter-century ago. <br><br> I listen for a primordial silence as well as voices coming down from a sphere within and beyond the rock of the self. When Hamlet concludes by murmuring, &#x201c;The rest is silence,&#x201d; he intends both an acceptance of oblivion and a longing for what Hermetists call the Pleroma or Fullï¿½ness. Valentinus the Gnostic sage concluded his &#x201c;Gospel of Truth&#x201d; by telling his congregation that it did not suit him, having been in the place of rest, to say anything more. For him too the rest was silence.</p><h2>Beneath the Neon: Life and Death in the Tunnels of Las Vegas</h2><p>The catacombs of ancient Rome served as houses of worship for Christians.

Newman discovers that a top military official is planning to betray his country by thwarting a mission to eliminate key Middle East terrorist leaders.</p><p>Oliver North is a combat decorated marine, a #1 best-selling author, the founder of a small business, an inventor with three U.S. patents, a syndicated newspaper columnist, former candidate for the United States Senate, popular public speaker, the host of a nationally syndicated daily radio show and the host of the weekly television series, War Stories on the FOX News channel, yet claims his most important accomplishment as being "the husband of one and the father of four." <p>North was born in San Antonio, Texas, graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and served 22 years as a U.S. Marine. His awards for service in combat include the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for valor and two Purple Hearts for wounds in combat.</p>It's hard to figure out just what North has in mind here: a little payback, perhaps, for some of the controversial ex-Marine's treatment by the Beltway establishment? A Christian tract disguised as a topical thriller? An attempt to use every single governmental abbreviation-from AmCits (American citizens) to WHDB (White House Data Base)-in one book? This giant novel (the first in a projected series of three) fits every one of those criteria, and also has a plot so convoluted that a snake might get motion sickness and characters so thin they make Tom Clancy look like Jane Austen. After flashbacks to three sets of killings in 1986, the narrative skips to 1994, when a career Marine Corps officer, Maj. Peter Newman, arrives at the Clinton White House to head a special projects office that hasn't been manned since another Marine-Oliver North-was booted out in 1987. "Look, if you think I'm going to accept a job only to go down in flames like he did, you'd better think again. I'll resign my commission first," Newman growls. But the major, who lost a younger brother in the military disaster at Mogadishu recounted in Black Hawk Down, takes the job when he realizes it will let him go after the warlords (including a rich Saudi called Osama bin Laden) responsible for that debacle. In a preface dated December 14, 2001, Fox News reporter North writes from aboard a U.S. warship with troops bound for Afghanistan, thanking coauthor Musser for his "gift for words" that "has made my military phraseology comprehensible to civilians."

Montalbano's long-suffering girlfriend, Livia, joins him with a friend husband and young son in tow to keep her company during these dog days of summer. But when the boy suddenly disappears into a narrow shaft hidden under the family s beach rental, Montalbano uncovers something terribly sinister. As the inspector spends the summer trying to solve this perplexing case, Livia refuses to answer his calls and Montalbano is left to take a plunge that will affect the rest of his life. Fans of the Sicilian inspector as well as readers new to this increasingly popular series will enjoy following the melancholy but unflinchingly moral Montalbano as he undertakes one of the most shocking investigations of his career.<br><br> <i>August Heat</i> is read by Grover Gardner who won the prestigious 2009 Audie(tm) Award for best narration in the mystery category for his reading of Camilleri's <i>Voice of the Violin</i>.</p><p>ANDREA CAMILLERI is an international bestselling author. He lives in Rome. <br><br> STEPHEN SARTARELLI is an award-winning translator and poet. He lives in France.Camilleri&#x2019;s alternately brooding and life-loving Sicilian police inspector Salvo Montalbano may be the most agonizingly human lead character in the mystery genre. The inspector&#x2019;s all-too-recognizable shortcomings, from lethargy to lust,&nbsp;are on view in this latest episode in which a summer rental&#x2014;procured by Salvo for friends of his girlfriend, Livia&#x2014;becomes a kind of Italian Amityville horror. If an insect infestation isn&#x2019;t enough to turn the holiday into a fiasco, the body found in a concealed basement apartment does the trick nicely, leaving Montalbano on the outs with Livia and forced to contend with a six-year-old murder. As the inspector endures the August heat (often by sitting in his office in his underwear), he faces an even more formidable obstacle: his overwhelming attraction to the victim&#x2019;s stunning twin sister. Montalbano&#x2019;s various weaknesses lead directly to the troubling finale, leaving him forced&nbsp;to, yes, strip off his clothes one more time and dive into the sea, hoping to swim away his regrets. Combine the movies Body Heat and The Seven-Year Itch, blending the noir of the former with the farce of the latter, and you have something like this beguiling tragicomedy. --Bill Ott</p><h2>Pillsbury: Best Cookies Cookbook: Favorite Recipes from America&#39;s Most-Trusted Kitchens</h2><p>The third title in the successful Pillsbury cookbook series features 175 of Pillsbury&#39;s best-ever recipes for cookies, bars, and brownies.

A complete revelation . . . Pye writes like a dream. Magnificent&#39; Jerry Brotton, author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps This is a story of saints and spies, of fishermen and pirates, traders and marauders - and of how their wild and daring journeys across the North Sea built the world we know. When the Roman Empire retreated, northern Europe was a barbarian outpost at the very edge of everything. A thousand years later, it was the heart of global empires and the home of science, art, enlightenment and money. We owe this transformation to the tides and storms of the North Sea. The water was dangerous, but it was far easier than struggling over land; so it was the sea that brought people together. Boats carried food and raw materials, but also new ideas and information. The seafarers raided, ruined and killed, but they also settled and coupled. With them they brought new tastes and technologies - books, clothes, manners, paintings and machines. In this dazzling historical adventure, we return to a time that is largely forgotten and watch as the modern world is born. We see the spread of money and how it paved the way for science. We see how plague terrorised even the rich and transformed daily life for the poor. We watch as the climate changed and coastlines shifted, people adapted and towns flourished. We see the arrival of the first politicians, artists, lawyers: citizens. From Viking raiders to Mongol hordes, Frisian fishermen to Hanseatic hustlers, travelling as far west as America and as far east as Byzantium, we see how the life and traffic of the seas changed everything. Drawing on an astonishing breadth of learning and packed with human stories and revelations, this is the epic drama of how we came to be who we are. &#39;A closely-researched and fascinating characterisation of the richness of life and the underestimated interconnections of the peoples all around the medieval and early modern North Sea.

But lately Death has been an uninvited guest at the hallowed rite. </p><p>Ute tribal policeman Charlie Moon is puzzled. The deceased Sun Dancers sustained no visible, life-ending injuries, so he is reluctant to call it murder -- though there is surely nothing "natural" about the sudden, inexplicable deaths of two strong and healthy men. Unlike her skeptical nephew, however, Charlie's aunt, shaman Daisy Perika, trusts the signs the spirits have sent her of a great evil in their midst. And Moon's <em>matukach</em> friend, Police Chief Scott Parris, believes the stubborn, good-natured Ute lawman should look beyond the rational for answers. Yet Charlie Moon knows too well that hatred, bitterness, and delusion are often behind lethal acts -- and he hopes these very human failings will reveal to him a killer. But now a beautiful childhood friend has stepped into harm's way and time is running out. For death is on the prowl once more -- and it will surely darken the Sun Dance again.</p></p><p>James D.

From London or Lvov, Bombay or Beijing, Dublin or Dusseldorf, people have come to America to remake themselves, their lives, and their identities. Despite political obstacles, popular indifference, or hostility, they put down roots here, and their social, cultural, and entrepreneurial energies helped forge the open and diverse society we live in. The history of American immigration has often been told by those already here.&nbsp;<i>Becoming Americans</i>&nbsp;tells this epic story from the inside, gathering for the first time over 400 years of writing&#x2014;from seventeenth-century Jamestown to contemporary Brooklyn and Los Angeles&#x2014;by first-generation immigrants about the immigrant experience. In sum, over eighty writers create a vivid, passionate, and revealing firsthand account of the challenges and aspirations that define our dynamic multicultural society.<br><br>In nearly 100 selections&#x2014;poems, stories, novel excerpts, travel pieces, diary entries, memoirs, and letters&#x2014;<i>Becoming Americans</i>&nbsp;presents the full range of the experience of coming to America: the reasons for departure, the journey itself, the shock and spectacle of first arrival, the passionate ambivalence toward the old country and the old life, and above all the struggle with the complexities of America.

And, though it represents the sixth novel in Pears's Jonathan Argyll series, the author subtly informs new readers of the key relationships and the past histories of his characters within the first three chapters. Once again, Argyll and his soon-to-be wife, Flavia di Stefano, are enmeshed in the Italian art world: Flavia, as a member of the Rome police's art squad and Argyll as a professor of art history. <p> The suspense of the novel is sustained by the careful revelation of the central art-theft plot; in turn, each major character becomes the narrative center and offers an expanded understanding of the events at San Giovanni. While Argyll is troubled over his fiancï¿½e's frequent absences just prior to their wedding, Flavia feels compelled to keep odd hours. She's certain that her old nemesis, Mary Verney, has returned to Rome with the intention of committing a major new theft. And Verney, readers soon learn, is herself in jeopardy. She <i>must</i> steal a Madonna icon from the monastery--despite the close scrutiny she faces from the Rome police force--because the sadistic Mikis Charanis has kidnapped Verney's granddaughter, 8-year-old Louise, and he will only release the child when Verney has acquired the artifact from San Giovanni. Underlying each character's concerns is the mystery of the Madonna itself. Why does Charanis covet this piece over the more valuable, though still dubious, Caravaggio that is also in the monastery? In the end, the novel is a perfect melding of a tightly composed mystery plot, witty dialogue, and a realistic sense of character, all flowing from an intellectual's appreciation for the finer things in life. For readers who discovered Pears's fiction through <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i>, the Argyll series--particularly <i>Death and Restoration</i>--offers much to satiate the need for his pleasantly baroque sensibilities. Other works in the Argyll series include <i>The Raphael Affair</i>, <i>The Titian Committee</i>, <i>The Bernini Bust</i>, <i>The Last Judgement</i>, and <i>Giotto's Hand</i>. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Iain Pears is a journalist and art historian who worked for Reuters for several years and spent time at Yale University completing his book <i>The Discovery of Painting,</i> which was published by Yale University Press in 1988.

Gases and dust particles ejected into the atmosphere changed weather patterns around the world, resulting in the infamous ''year without a summer'' in North America, food riots in Europe, and a widespread cholera epidemic. And the gloomy weather inspired Mary Shelley to write the gothic novel <i>Frankenstein</i>.</p><br><p> This book tells the story of nine such epic volcanic events, explaining the related geology for the general reader and exploring the myriad ways in which the earth's volcanism has affected human history. Zeilinga de Boer and Sanders describe in depth how volcanic activity has had long-lasting effects on societies, cultures, and the environment. After introducing the origins and mechanisms of volcanism, the authors draw on ancient as well as modern accounts--from folklore to poetry and from philosophy to literature. Beginning with the Bronze Age eruption that caused the demise of Minoan Crete, the book tells the human and geological stories of eruptions of such volcanoes as Vesuvius, Krakatau, Mount Pelï¿½e, and Tristan da Cunha. Along the way, it shows how volcanism shaped religion in Hawaii, permeated Icelandic mythology and literature, caused widespread population migrations, and spurred scientific discovery.</p><br><p> From the prodigious eruption of Thera more than 3,600 years ago to the relative burp of Mount St. Helens in 1980, the results of volcanism attest to the enduring connections between geology and human destiny.</p></p><p>In 1815, Napoleon's armies fell to defeat at Waterloo, a clash that would change the course of world events. Far more Europeans died that year, though, as a result of a volcanic explosion in Indonesia--one cataclysmic eruption among the many that figure in this sidelong view of the Earth's history.<p> The explosion of Tambora in April 1815, geologists de Boer and Sanders write, sent a plume of volcanic ash high into the planet's atmosphere, bringing on a "nuclear winter" that devastated crops in the northern hemisphere, yielding famine and plague. Moreover, they add, the explosion cast a hazy pall over much of Europe, a gloom that inspired Mary Shelley to write her famed novel, <i>Frankenstein</i>. Another explosion, more than 3,000 years earlier, pulverized the Mediterranean island of Thera, giving rise to the legend of Atlantis and causing whole civilizations to collapse. Still another eruption on the island of Tristan da Cunha, in 1961, "brought [the 20th century] to this most isolated of the earth's inhabited places."</p><p> The authors' overview of nature's ability to thwart human intentions makes for fascinating reading, sure to appeal to fans of <i>Perils of a Restless Planet</i>, <i>Surviving Galeras</i>, and other chronicles of the trembling earth. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><p>"Most people seldom think about volcanoes or the role they have played in human history. Jelle Zeilinga de Boer and Donald Theodore Sanders . . . examine the relationship between volcanoes and human history. . . . [Their] chilling examples show the profound impact volcanic eruptions have had upon humans. The incredible story has taken centuries to unfold and will surely continue to evolve."<b>--Dr. Robert D. Ballard, President, Institute for Exploration, Mystic, Connecticut</b><br></p><br><p>"There is a growing awareness of the interplay between natural disasters and human societies, putting this book at the cutting edge of an important trend. It integrates science with societal issues in a way that is compelling and interesting. With its informative but nontechnical style, it should appeal to both scientists and nonspecialists."<b>--Susan Hough, U.S. Geological Survey</b><br></p><br></p><h2>At Bertram&#39;s Hotel: A Miss Marple Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)</h2><p>Miss Jane Marple has checked into Bertram's Hotel in London for a much-needed vacation.

He is now writing full-time.The seventh novel set in Reynolds's Revelation Space milieu (most recently encountered in his 2007 collection <i>Galactic North</i>) is a fascinating hybrid of space opera, police procedural and character study. One of the 10,000 colony habitats of the utopian Glitter Band has been destroyed, and title character Tom Dreyfus, a cop who patrols the Glitter Band beat, is assigned to learn whodunit and why. Meanwhile, his protï¿½gï¿½, Thalia Ng, shepherds a supposedly minor series of software upgrades on several other habitats, while Dreyfus's superiors oust their leader, ostensibly for her own good. Reynolds unfolds revelations layer by onionskin layer, supplying enough detail to imply a novel's worth of unwritten backstory without ever obscuring the stakes and personalities.

Funny Business is set against the backdrop of a high-powered comics convention. When some valuable comic books disappear, the threesome discover just how serious and cutthroat the comics business can be. In Rough Stuff, the Investigators' small private plane crashes in the mountains, far from civilization. When the pilot (and father of one of the Three Investigators) mysteriously disappears, the teens go exploring and discover an isolated Indian Village. Of the two, Funny Business is somewhat less predictable, and it features a nice twist in which the pudgy, girl-shy Jupe Jones finally finds romance. In both novels, the characters are rather stereotyped, including the Three Investigators themselves: brainy Jupe, athletic Pete, and good-looking Bob. Still, the characters are appealing, and there is plenty of action. Satisfying, albeit unmemorable mysteries which should be popular with young readers. --Ruth Sadasivan, Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, OH<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Desert Flower</h2><p>Waris Dirie (the name means desert flower) lives a double life - by day she is a famous model and UN spokeswoman on women&#39;s rights in Africa, at night she dreams of her native Somalia. Waris, one of 12 children, was born into a traditional family of desert nomads in East Africa. She remembers her early childhood as carefree- racing camels and moving on with her family to the next grazing spot - until it came her turn to meet the old woman who administered the ancient custom imposed on most Somalian girls: circumcision. Waris suffered this torture when she was just five years old. Then, aged 12, when her father attempted to arrange a marriage with a 60 year old stranger in exchange for five camels - she took flight. After an extraordinary escape through the dangerous desert she made her way to London and worked as a maid for the Somalian ambassador until that family returned home. Penniless and speaking little English, she became a janitor in McDonalds where she was famously discovered by a fashion photographer. Her story is a truly inspirational and extraordinary self-portrait of a remarkable woman whose spirit is as breathtaking as her beauty.</p><p>By age 6, Waris Dirie was herding her family's sheep and goats, fending off hyenas and wild dogs as the family carved a path through Africa. She was just twice that age when she ran off into the vast furnace of the Somali desert to escape an arranged marriage to a much older man. Traveling for days without food and water, she made her way to Mogadishu and later to London as a servant to her uncle, the Somalian ambassador. There she wrestled with culture shock and got her first taste of the modeling life that eventually brought her into the public eye. Dirie is resilient, having survived drought, hunger, and the ritual female genital mutilation that marks a step toward womanhood among some traditional Moslems but, argue critics, steals or ruins many girls' lives. "As we traveled throughout Somalia," says Dirie, "we met families and I played with their daughters. When we visited them again, the girls were missing. No one spoke the truth about their absence or even spoke of them at all." As a special ambassador to the United Nations, Dirie has spoken out loudly on this subject and championed environmental causes, too. How much of her sometimes breathless story is gospel truth and how much embellished is hard to say. Like Dirie herself, though, the combination is intriguing, powerful, and unique. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>Waris Dirie is an internationally renowned model and face of Revlon skincare products. She was appointed by the United Nations in 1997 as a special ambassador for women&#39;s rights to eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation.

Taplin (classics, Magdalen Coll., Oxford) explores the continuing impact of ancient Greece on the modern world in aesthetics, architecture, philosophy, political science, science, sexual behavior, values, attitudes toward war, and the personal quest to know oneself and confront the tragic condition of life. The ten chapters expand on themes explored in the ten segments of the series (they will be shown in five segments on A&amp;E). Taplin is aware of the dangers of superficiality in such a sweeping undertaking, and, indeed, the chapters are uneven. But for the well-educated audience for whom the book is intended, it provides an interesting update on the influence of the Greeks. The work is nicely illustrated. There may be some demand because of the cable TV series. Recommended for academic and public libraries.<br><i>- Jeffrey R.

Sixteen months later, the king&#x2019;s fifth wife would follow her cousin Anne Boleyn to the scaffold, having been convicted of adultery and high treason.<br> <br>The broad outlines of Catherine&#x2019;s career might be familiar, but her story up until now has been incomplete. Unlike previous accounts of her life, which portray her as a naï¿½ve victim of an ambitious family, this compelling and authoritative biography will shed new light on Catherine Howard&#x2019;s rise and downfall by reexamining her motives and showing her in her context, a milieu that goes beyond her family and the influential men of the court to include the aristocrats and, most critically, the servants who surrounded her and who, in the end, conspired against her. By illuminating Catherine's entwined upstairs/downstairs worlds as well as societal tensions beyond the palace walls, the author offers a fascinating portrayal of court life in the sixteenth century and a fresh analysis of the forces beyond Catherine&#x2019;s control that led to her execution&#x2014;from diplomatic pressure and international politics to the long-festering resentments against the queen&#x2019;s household at court.<br> <br>Including a forgotten text of Catherine&#x2019;s confession in her own words, color illustrations, family tree, map, and extensive notes, <i>Young and Damned and Fair</i> changes our understanding of one of history&#x2019;s most famous women while telling the compelling and very human story of complex individuals attempting to survive in a dangerous age.</p><p>Educated at Oxford University and Queens University, Belfast, Gareth Russell is a historian, novelist, and playwright.

So when Thomas Cromwell was led out to his death on July 28, 1540,1 he had the comfort of knowing that he had been granted the privilege of preparing to stand in the presence of the Almighty. The day was sweltering, one in a summer so hot and so dry that no rain fell on the kingdom from spring until the end of September, but the bulky hard-bitten man from Putney who had become the King&#x2019;s most trusted confidant and then his chief minister walked cheerfully towards the scaffold.2 He even called out to members of the crowd and comforted his nervous fellow prisoner Walter, Lord Hungerford, who was condemned to die alongside him for four crimes, all of which carried the death penalty. Lord Hungerford, whose sanity was questionable, had allegedly committed heresy, in appointing as his private chaplain a priest rumored to remain loyal to the Pope; witchcraft, by consorting with various individuals, including one named &#x201c;Mother Roche,&#x201d; to use necromancy to guess the date of the King&#x2019;s death; treason, in that both his chaplain&#x2019;s appointment and the meeting with the witch constituted a crime against the King&#x2019;s majesty; and sodomy, &#x201c;the abominable and detestable vice and sin of buggery,&#x201d; made a capital crime in 1534, in going to bed with two of his male servants, men called William Master and Thomas Smith.3<br> <br>Rumors, fermenting in the baking heat and passed between courtiers, servants, merchants, and diplomats who had nothing to do but sweat and trade in secrets, had already enlarged the scope of Lord Hungerford&#x2019;s crimes. The French ambassador reported back to Paris that the condemned man had also been guilty of sexually assaulting his own daughter. It was whispered that Hungerford had practiced black magic, violating the laws of Holy Church that prohibited sorcery as a link to the Devil. Others heard that Hungerford&#x2019;s true crime had been actively plotting the murder of the King.4 None of those charges were ever mentioned in the indictments leveled against Hungerford at his trial, but the man dying alongside him had perfected this tactic of smearing a victim with a confusing mï¿½lange of moral turpitudes guaranteed to excite prurient speculation and kill a person&#x2019;s reputation before anyone was tempted to raise a voice in his defense.<br> <br>The hill where they now stood had been the site of the finales to some of Cromwell&#x2019;s worst character assassinations. It had been there, four years earlier on another summer&#x2019;s day, that George Boleyn had perished before similarly large crowds after Cromwell arranged a trial that saw him condemned to death on charges of incest and treason. The details of Boleyn&#x2019;s alleged treason had been kept deliberately vague during the trial, while the prosecution&#x2019;s fanciful descriptions of his incestuous seduction of his sister the Queen had been excruciatingly, pornographically vivid. Boleyn, as handsome as Adonis and proud as Icarus, had defended himself so well against the accusations there had been bets that he would be acquitted.5 When he was not, when he was condemned to die alongside four other men two days later, no one could risk speaking out for a man found guilty of committing such a bestial act.<br> <br>Within the Tower&#x2019;s sheltered courtyards, Boleyn&#x2019;s sister Queen Anne was executed in a more private setting, before a carefully vetted crowd of around one thousand, which was tiny in comparison to that allowed to gather beyond the walls to watch her brother perish&#x2014;and now Cromwell and Walter Hungerford.6 Like Thomas More before her, another political heavyweight in whose destruction Cromwell had been intimately involved, Anne Boleyn had embraced the sixteenth century&#x2019;s veneration for the ars moriendi&#x2014;the art of dying.<br> <br>The veil between life and death was made permeable by the teachings of Christianity. Everywhere one looked, there was proof of society&#x2019;s lively fascination with the next life. Death was the great moral battleground between one&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses; the supreme test came when the finite perished and the eternal began. To die well, in a spirit of resignation to the Will of God and without committing a sin against hope by despairing of what was to come next, was a goal endlessly stressed to the faithful in art, sermons, homilies, and manuals. Within the great basilica of Saint-Denis in Paris, the tomb of King Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, his queen, showed the couple rendered perfect in the stonemasons&#x2019; marble, united atop the monument, their bejeweled hands clasped in prayer, their robes and crowns exquisitely carved, but beneath that sculpture the craftsmen had offered a very different portrait of the royal forms&#x2014;there, the bodies of the King and Queen were shown twisting and writhing in the first stages of putrefaction, their feet bare, their hair uncovered, and their flesh pullulating with the onset of corruption.7 Throughout Europe, these cadaver tombs, the transi, were commissioned by the rich and the powerful to show their submission to the final destruction of their flesh and with it the removal of this sinful world&#x2019;s most potent temptations. In corruption they had been born and so through corruption they could be born again.<br> <br>In the sixteenth century, life was precious, truncated at any moment by plague, war, or one of a thousand ailments that would be rendered treatable in the centuries to come, and so the people embraced it with a rare vitality. But living well, as Anne Boleyn had noted at her trial, also meant dying well.8 Christians were supposed to die bravely because of the surety of mercy that even the weakest and most sinful was guaranteed by their religion, provided he or she had respected its doctrines and honored its God. Before they were marched to the hill, Cromwell told Lord Hungerford that &#x201c;though the breakfast which we are going to be sharp, yet, trusting to the mercy of the Lord, we shall have a joyful dinner.&#x201d;9 To the overwhelming number of Henry VIII&#x2019;s subjects, Christianity was not a theory, it was not a belief system, it was not one religion among many&#x2014;it was, more or less, a series of facts, the interpretation of which could be debated, but whose essential truth was inescapable and uncontested. The result of this way of accepting and experiencing their faith was that sixteenth-century Christians often behaved in ways which were paradoxically far more devout but also far more relaxed than their modern-day coreligionists. The line between sinners and the flock was not so clearly delineated, because even the worst members of society were still, in one way or the other, almost certainly believing Christians. All men were weak, all men would fail, all men would die, all men could be saved.<br> <br>To many of their contemporaries, there was an inextricable link between Cromwell&#x2019;s submission to mortality and the ascent in royal favor of the Duke of Norfolk&#x2019;s niece, a view vividly captured by the juxtaposition of Cromwell&#x2019;s death and the King&#x2019;s marriage to the orphaned Catherine Howard on the same day. In the countryside, beyond the stench and sweat of the crowd assembled to watch Cromwell and Hungerford&#x2019;s deaths, Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London, prepared to preside over the King&#x2019;s wedding service. The pretty palace of Oatlands sat in a rolling deer park, its loveliness marred only by the building work that the King, with his passion for architecture, had ordered three years earlier when the manor had come into his possession.10 A fortune was spent on transforming the seldom-used Oatlands into a retreat fit for the sovereign. An octagonal tower, still a work in progress on the day Cromwell was struck down, was added to the courtyard. Terraced gardens were constructed with multiple fountains, each one an enormous extravagance splashing cooling streams of water. An orchard, its mature trees groaning under the weight of fruit, offered shade to the heads of courtiers and servants, as they endured the stifling heat. The orchard was new, but the trees were not. They had been uprooted from Saint Peter&#x2019;s Abbey and brought to grace the King&#x2019;s gardens when the abbey was shut down, its brothers expelled and its possessions stripped by Cromwell&#x2019;s inspectors. The stones that built the little palace&#x2019;s expansion had come from the Augustinian priory at Tandridge as it was pulled down to make way for aristocratic demesnes. The price paid by many of his subjects for the King&#x2019;s religious revolution weighed heavily and silently on Oatlands, but as thick carpets from the Ottoman Empire, chairs upholstered in velvets and cloth of gold, gilt cups, bejeweled table services, and beds hung with cloth of silver were all processed into Oatlands, there was little outward sign of the tribulation that had gone into making it suitable for the royal household.11<br> <br>Edmund Bonner was an Oxford graduate in his early forties. Bonner had risen from relative obscurity, which encouraged accusations that he had been born out of wedlock, to become England&#x2019;s ambassador to France and, after that, Bishop of London.12 He had secured both his ambassadorship and episcopacy through Thomas Cromwell&#x2019;s patronage, yet like everybody else he had abandoned Cromwell in his hour of need. The latter&#x2019;s frantic letters from prison, entreating royal mercy from Henry, written in a disjointed and panicky mess compared to his usual precise calligraphy, had gone unanswered, as all of Cromwell&#x2019;s former dependents turned their faces from him, as if he had never existed.<br> <br>A celebrated person&#x2019;s execution, his final public performance, was such an exciting event that people made the journey into London especially for it. Vast numbers of people surged through the city, converging on Tower Hill to watch the annihilation of the detested commoner who had somehow risen to become Earl of Essex&#x2014;a sign of royal favor given to him only a few weeks before he was arrested at a meeting of the Privy Council and taken to the Tower. The last ascent in the life of the Englishman who had risen farther than anyone else in his century was the wooden steps to the scaffold. Thomas Cromwell had not been a popular figure, but royal advisers seldom are. Snobbery played a large role in shaping his reputation&#x2014;an English diplomat described Cromwell as a man who had been &#x201c;advanced from the dunghill to great honour&#x201d;&#x2014;but so did his actions.13 Ruthless, determined, brilliant, and utterly Machiavellian, Cromwell had overseen the destruction of many an aristocratic career and the evisceration of the old religion in England. Many of his opponents blamed him for tearing asunder the spiritual framework that they had lived, and hoped to die, by. The sacraments and liturgies of the Church had given a rhythm to the year; they had bestowed the tools for salvation on the faithful for centuries, and marked every major moment in a Christian&#x2019;s life. In 1536, Cromwell had weathered a traditionalist uprising&#x2019;s attempts to remove him from power, but he could not survive the loss of the King&#x2019;s favor four years later. His enemies surrounded him, and he was condemned to death on a long list of crimes that included heresy, treason, and financial corruption.<br> <br>The crowds entering the capital on July 28, 1540, came from every background, with well-born women wearing veils to shield their faces from the sun, while urchins wore battered hand-me-down cheap leather shoes which prevented their feet from being cut on the animal bones and refuse that littered the city streets. With no rain, the mud in the streets had become a dry dust that would turn into ankle-depth filth when the clouds broke in autumn. The spectators passed through the capital&#x2019;s eighteen-foot-high defensive walls via one of the seven gates. Those traveling in from the Hampshire countryside entered through Newgate, while those from Smithfield, home to a bustling meat market, accessed the city at Aldersgate. Smithfield also contained London&#x2019;s designated red-light district, the aptly named Cock Lane. Subtlety in the assigning of place names was not a medieval strong point. The southern city of Exeter had renamed one of its rivers Shitbrook, because of the amount of feces and waste it contained, and in Oxford, students hoping for an early sexual experience courtesy of the town&#x2019;s prostitutes could find it on Gropecunt Lane, a narrow alley that ran from just opposite the university church of Saint Mary the Virgin down to the entrance of Oriel College.14<br> <br>Rather more elegant sights awaited those who were traveling towards Cromwell&#x2019;s execution via The Strand, a long straight road lined with the episcopal palaces and impressive homes of the aristocracy. The Strand had been the site of the Savoy Palace, principal residence of Richard II&#x2019;s powerful uncle John of Gaunt, until it was burned down during the Peasants&#x2019; Revolt of 1381. It had eventually been replaced by the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist, one of the most impressive medical establishments in early modern Europe, founded under the patronage of Henry VIII&#x2019;s father. Near the hospital was one of the Eleanor Crosses, funerary monuments erected by a grief-stricken Edward I in 1290 to mark each of the fourteen spots where his wife&#x2019;s coffin rested on its final journey to Westminster Abbey. This, the last put-down before the internment, was now where professional water-sellers traded their wares, taking advantage of the area&#x2019;s excellent plumbing which on occasion pumped the local fountains with wine or beer to celebrate an especially significant royal event&#x2014;the last time had been for the birth of the heir to the throne, Prince Edward, in 1537. On a hot and busy day like this, as families and groups of friends swarmed towards the Tower, the Charing Cross water-sellers could reasonably have expected to turn a handsome profit, but even at this early stage of what turned out to be the hottest summer of the sixteenth century, the Westminster plumbing was struggling to provide the capital&#x2019;s wealthiest region with the water it needed.15<br> <br>There was no sign of similar deprivations at Oatlands, where any eastern- or western-facing windows above the quadrangle provided views either of the orchard with its purloined apple trees, an octagonal dovecote, or ornamental gardens circling the fountains. We cannot say for certain where in Oatlands Catherine Howard resided during her wedding visit. Recent excavations of the palace have given us a better picture of its layout, and the safest guess would be that her rooms were in the Queen&#x2019;s apartments, located in the palace&#x2019;s southern towers between the inner and outer courtyards. From just above the entrance to the inner courtyard, she would have been able to see the ramp that had recently been installed to help her husband-to-be mount what must have been a particularly sturdy steed. Beyond the walls lay the deer park where she and the King would spend a few days of hunting as part of a ten-day honeymoon.<br> <br>Catherine was in her late teens, slender, like most of the Howard women, with a &#x201c;very delightful&#x201d; appearance, according to the French ambassador.16 The court&#x2019;s temporary reductio...</p><h2>No Turn Unstoned: Worst Ever Theatrical Reviews</h2><p>The noted British actress presents an entertaining collection of blistering critics&#39; reviews, contributed by a number of illustrious actors and actresses, directors, producers, and playwrights</p><p></p><h2>KnockOut: An FBI Thriller (FBI Thrillers)</h2><p>Traveling with her mother to Georgia in the aftermath of her father&#39;s death, seven-year-old telepath Autumn Backman discovers her own family&#39;s murderous activities, desperately contacts FBI agent Dillon Savich, and promptly disappears, a situation for which Savich launches a large-scale manhunt. 400,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Catherine Coulter</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i>ï¿½&#x2013;bestselling FBI thrillers <i>The Cove, The Maze, The Target, The Edge, Riptide, Hemlock Bay, Eleventh House, Blindside, Blowout, Point Blank, Double Take,</i> and <i>TailSpin</i>.Starred Review.

Does love ever work the way we say it does in movies and books and Facebook posts? Or does obsessing over those love stories hurt our real-life relationships? When her parents divorced after a twenty-eight year marriage and her own ten-year relationship ended, those were the questions that Mandy Len Catron wanted to answer.<br> <br>In a series of candid, vulnerable, and wise essays that takes a closer look at what it means to love someone, be loved, and how we present our love to the world, Catron deconstructs her own personal canon of love stories. She delves all the way back to 1944, when her grandparents first met in a coal mining town in Appalachia, to her own dating life as a professor in Vancouver, drawing insights from her fascinating research into the universal psychology, biology, history, and literature of love. She uses biologists&#x2019; research into dopamine triggers to ask whether the need to love is an innate human drive. She uses literary theory to show why we prefer certain kinds of love stories. She urges us to question the unwritten scripts we follow in relationships and looks into where those scripts come from in the first place. And she tells the story of how she decided to test a psychology experiment that she&#x2019;d read about&#x2014;where the goal was to create intimacy between strangers using a list of thirty-six questions&#x2014;and ended up in the surreal situation of having millions of people following her brand-new relationship.<br> <br>In <i>How to Fall in Love with Anyone</i> Catron flips the script on love and offers a deeply personal, and universal, investigation.</p><p>Originally from Appalachian Virginia, Mandy Len Catron now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her writing has appeared in the <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>New York Times, </i>The Walrus, and The Rumpus as well as literary journals and anthologies.

His blond hair pokes out from under his hat&#x2014;a hat that sits high on his head, the kind truck drivers wear. It curls a little, his hair, and though he is a little wider at the hips, narrower in the shoulders, he is mostly lean. His face and neck and forearms are tanned from long afternoons on the football field. He wears the same shorts they all do&#x2014;gray polyester, fitted, cut to mid-thigh, two snaps at the waist&#x2014;coaches&#x2019; shorts. His T-shirts are from wrestling events he refereed in college. (Wrestling: a sport he, and most everyone else, pronounces as &#x201c;wrasslin&#x2019;.&#x201d;) He chews tobacco&#x2014;Red Man. Spits in an empty Coke bottle.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s seen him around, looking always like he knows where he&#x2019;s going but is not in a hurry. He walks down the halls of her high school with wide strides, the same way he moves down the sidelines on Friday nights. But he is slower inside, making eye contact with the people he passes, always smiling, always friendly to the custodian, and the ladies in the cafeteria kitchen. He calls them by name. After only a few weeks he knows more people than she does, and she&#x2019;s lived her whole life here. When he speaks, his accent is different from hers. He is not from here, she already knows, but several counties away. They both stretch the i in mines and pines and time, letting it flatten in their mouths. But when he says &#x201c;coal,&#x201d; he pronounces the l, unlike the people around her who clip it to coe. Coe mines.<br> <br>She can see right away why they all like him&#x2014;the players and the other coaches and the students in his Advanced PE class. Ease. That&#x2019;s what he has, she thinks. He&#x2019;s easy. When they sit down in the empty classroom, every question she asks seems entirely natural, as if it&#x2019;s not an interview but a conversation between old acquaintances who meet unexpectedly&#x2014;happily, even&#x2014;after a few years apart. He has a knack for banter, a way of making her&#x2014;or anyone, really&#x2014;feel that they&#x2019;ve got something significant in common: a shared love of sunny afternoons or blackberry cobbler that&#x2019;s downright intimate. And he looks her straight in the eyes when she&#x2019;s speaking. His lack of self-consciousness is expansive. She actually feels charming, like she&#x2019;s flirting a little, something she doesn&#x2019;t normally do. She finds herself smiling a lot, a big smile that shows her gums and her slightly gapped teeth. The Taylor smile, she once heard a boy say. It&#x2019;s the one feature she shares with all five of her sisters.<br> <br>The afternoon light warms the oiled-canvas window shades, and the chalkboards and desks glow a little. It&#x2019;s sweltering September in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. Where is he from, she asks (though she already knows&#x2014;Wythe County, a farm boy), and why did he choose to move here, to Lee County, and what does he like most about coaching? His answers are straightforward, not profound but printable, quotable. She likes this. It makes her job easy. He says the people here are just as nice as can be, that the view of the mountains from the door of his trailer is plain gorgeous, that the cafeteria rolls taste a whole lot like his mom&#x2019;s. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if they like you, only that they respect you,&#x201d; he says about the ballplayers, looking serious but not severe, his boyishness momentarily receding. She listens intently, unconsciously fingering the straight blond hair she wears parted in the center and hanging down to her hips. Eventually she stops looking at the list of questions she&#x2019;s written out in her notebook and they just talk. She does not chew on the end of her pen or stare down at her cuticles. Unlike in other interviews, she does not even think about what she should say before she says it. The conversation propels itself without effort in the regular and relaxed way the hands move around the clock. Occasionally she remembers the profile she&#x2019;s writing for the school newspaper and jots a few things down in her notebook. Occasionally she thinks of her best friend and coeditor Connie, who&#x2019;d offered her the interview with the new football coach, saying, &#x201c;I hear he&#x2019;s a real asshole.&#x201d; Had she been thinking of someone else?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, gosh,&#x201d; he says suddenly, drawing out his o&#x2019;s, looking at the clock. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a meeting in the field house,&#x201d; he tells her, &#x201c;but thank you,&#x201d; as if it&#x2019;s she who&#x2019;s doing him a favor by conducting the interview. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; she replies, before realizing she is the one who ought to thank him. He stands, but not quite straight, keeping his left hand on the desk, and extends his right hand toward her. She&#x2019;s not used to shaking hands with teachers or friends, but he&#x2019;s not quite either of those things. His palm is big, his grip firm, almost formal. He nods and smiles and shakes in a single, coordinated gesture, like the preacher after Sunday service. When he grins, his bright blue eyes narrow, squeezed by his cheeks.<br> <br>The profile is easy to write. That night she finishes it in a couple of hours, pausing only to think up the words to describe him: Nice? Friendly? With a hint of mischief? Yes, yes, but she can&#x2019;t quite squeeze it into a single sentence. There&#x2019;s something about the way he hovers around adulthood but doesn&#x2019;t touch down, she thinks. It&#x2019;s his certainty that buoys him, the way he walks around town as if he&#x2019;s lived his whole life here. The faith he places in the rules of the game. More than his ease, she envies this about him: that the world he inhabits is so ordered. Coach Catron loves football as much as his mom&#x2019;s Sunday dinners, she writes. He&#x2019;s one of those rare people who, at twenty-two, is doing exactly what he was born to do. When you first meet him, you&#x2019;ll know this immediately.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>I realize, according to all generally accepted knowledge of time and memory and biology, that it is not possible that I could remember the day my parents met, but I do. I remember it as if I lived it. I can see the way he grinned at her when she introduced herself, like he could tell they&#x2019;d be friends. And the way she almost but not quite smiled back. I can see the afternoon light in the classroom, though I don&#x2019;t actually know where the interview took place. Still, it is as real to me as every other memory in my brain.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve always thought of stories as records, as ways of remembering our lives. And I thought it was our duty to tell them, to keep the past alive in the present&#x2014;to keep ourselves alive. As in: I tell, therefore I am.<br> <br>&#x201c;My mom is twenty-nine,&#x201d; I said smugly to the other second-grade girls as we sat around the lunch table and talked about our mothers. She was the youngest mom (though not by much), and I felt proud of this. &#x201c;My mom met my dad when she was a cheerleader and he was the new football coach at her high school. She can still do a cartwheel.&#x201d;<br> <br>At seven I was allowed to be solipsistic about the story of my life, to tell and retell the boy-meets-girl that brought me into being. I wish I could say that I eventually outgrew this story, that I got tired of it. But I&#x2019;ve spent decades recounting it for anyone who would listen.<br> <br>For the first eighteen years of my life, I spent every Friday of every fall beside a football field. I was walking home from work one day when some combination of scents&#x2014;the damp of rotting fall leaves, a waft of cigarette smoke&#x2014;called to mind the squat cinder-block bathrooms that stood behind the end zone of a rural Virginia football field. I could see the green-tinged walls and the broken hand driers and the brown paper towels that littered the concrete floors. Just outside the bathroom, high school girls and grandmas sucked on Camel Lights and gossiped between quarters.<br> <br>I remember running around behind the bleachers, palming a couple of clammy dollar bills for a plate of nachos&#x2014;the plastic kind with a separate compartment for the yellow liquid cheese. Sometimes the ladies at the concession stand gave the coaches&#x2019; daughters free hot chocolate in little Styrofoam cups. Sometimes we bought Now and Laters or those gritty sweet-and-sour pastel lollipops that burned your tongue if you ate the whole thing.<br> <br>Dad paced the sidelines in his polyester shorts, his hat brim tilted skyward, his clipboard in hand (a clipboard his daughters decorated with bubble letters in green and gold paint markers). His face was serious but otherwise inexpressive, a coach&#x2019;s poker face. I barely watched the games, but I knew to turn toward the field when the crowd leaped up, to pay attention when our team neared the goal line. I wanted to win because I liked winning, but also because I liked walking into the field house with Mom and my younger sister, Casey, after the game and smelling the sweaty, foam-rubber scent of victory. Those nights, we stayed up late eating seven-layer dip and Jell-O salad and watching TV while the coaches and their wives drank light beer in someone&#x2019;s refinished basement.<br> <br>There was always a crowd, even when the away team came from over the mountains, because on Friday nights in southwestern Virginia, football was what people did. I loved the ceremony of it: the opening prayer and the national anthem and the local news crews setting up cameras. The announcer&#x2019;s rumble as the boys tore through the paper banner. I liked the scent of grass stains and pepperoni, and how the bleachers shook before the first punt as the crowd thundered their feet in accelerating suspense. I liked the drum majors&#x2019; spangled uniforms and neat movements, the whirling rifles of the color guard at halftime. That I would be a cheerleader, taking my place in the drama of the game as soon as I was able, was a given from the start.<br> <br>&#x201c;The greatest thing in the world to me was going to a football game,&#x201d; my mom said of her teenage years.<br> <br>My mom was never alone as a child. She never had friends over. She never went anywhere other than to school or church, to visit family, to lay silk flowers on the veterans&#x2019; graves at the cemetery. (The cemetery was the only place family photos were taken, with the kids lined up tallest to shortest.) Football games meant somewhere to go, something to do, a ride out of town surrounded by friends. A winning team meant leaving the mountains, staying in a hotel.<br> <br>Maybe, to an outsider, the world of high school football seems incidental to their love story, little more than a setting. And I understand why it might seem this way. Since I moved to Canada, football has shifted to the far margins of my life; I don&#x2019;t go to games or watch them on TV, though my dad will often text me a photo of the Virginia Tech stadium on a sunny Saturday afternoon. But when I was young, love&#x2014;my parents&#x2019; love and the love of our family and the daily domestic life we all shared&#x2014;was tethered to football. To my mind, football made our family.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>When I was a kid, I loved to say to my mom: &#x201c;Tell me about when you were my age.&#x201d; But her answer was always the same: There wasn&#x2019;t that much to tell. She never had the nice things Casey and I did. We were so lucky&#x2014;did I realize that?<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think she meant to be evasive. She just couldn&#x2019;t see that what seemed mundane to her fascinated me: the roads that wound through mountain hollows, the men who spent their days underground&#x2014;doing what exactly? Digging? I wanted to know how it felt to have seven siblings and to sleep&#x2014;all eight of you&#x2014;in a single bedroom in a four-room cabin perched on the side of a mountain.<br> <br>My dad sometimes joked about my mom&#x2019;s childhood. He told me the movie Coal Miner&#x2019;s Daughter was actually about her. He said he bought her her first pair of shoes.<br> <br>Mom said that she was lucky to get a MoonPie and an RC Cola for lunch. She said she was so skinny the other kids told her to turn sideways and stick out her tongue, then they called her Zipper.<br> <br>I was too young to really understand poverty; I still believed that poor people were happier than the rest of us, because a world in which some people were both poor and miserable seemed too cruel to be real. I never considered the possibility that the past might be a place my mom would prefer to avoid.<br> <br>As I got older, I stopped asking about my mom&#x2019;s life, but I stuck with my project of piecing the story together myself. One day she&#x2019;d mention the Jeep she drove in college. Or she&#x2019;d show me how to make Mamaw&#x2019;s cornbread. She&#x2019;d glance at my baggy jeans and tell me that when she was in high school, the girls wore pants so tight they had to lie down on the bed just to zip them up. And there were the photos hanging around the house: of her and her sisters on a swing set, her parents&#x2014;young and leggy&#x2014;leaning into each other by the ocean, all eight kids dressed up and standing next to a tombstone in order from tallest to shortest.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think anyone ever sat me down and told me the full story about how my parents met and fell in love. That it exists, whole and coherent, is thanks to me. I am the story&#x2019;s author and keeper; I assembled its pieces, filling in any holes with intuition or inference. And I can no longer be sure what is original and what was added.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>&#x201c;Connie said he was an asshole and refused to interview him,&#x201d; Mom told me one day. &#x201c;So she made me do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I must&#x2019;ve been old enough for her to use the word asshole, so it can&#x2019;t have been the first time I heard about their meeting. But this is how the story begins for me&#x2014;an interview with an asshole. I don&#x2019;t remember a time when it began differently.<br> <br>I always include that word, asshole, when I tell the story. Probably because it&#x2019;s such a poor descriptor for my father, a man who is so friendly and well liked that I spent my childhood avoiding trips to the grocery store with him, knowing we&#x2019;d be sidelined for a lengthy conversation when we inevitably ran into someone he knew. Even people he doesn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;the cashier, the tour guide, the friends I introduce him to&#x2014;are charmed by him immediately.<br> <br>Maybe at twenty-two he still had the arrogance of a college athlete, or the seriousness of a young man new to a position of authority. Maybe he could seem like an asshole. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more important to be respected than to be liked,&#x201d; he told me when I was twenty-two and facing down my first classroom of college freshmen.<br> <br>That Connie was so wrong about my dad, that she was unknowingly referring to the man my mom would marry four years later, is, I think, one of my favorite parts of the story.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>When Casey was in high school she had two boys vying for her attention (something I couldn&#x2019;t have fathomed at sixteen). When she asked us for advice, Mom looked at her and said simply, &#x201c;Date them both.&#x201d; The three of us were folding laundry in my bedroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re way too young to worry about committing to one person,&#x201d; Mom said, adding casually: &#x201c;You know, I was seeing other people right up until your dad and I got engaged.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I cut in. &#x201c;But you weren&#x2019;t really dating other people.&#x201d; It landed somewhere between a statement and an interrogation.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was,&#x201d; she said, without elaboration.<br> <br>It was such a small thing, an aside, and yet it was the first time I ever had occasion to question the version of the story I&#x2019;d spent years crafting and retelling. I&#x2019;d always imagined my dad was the only one for my mom, that she&#x2019;d ditched her high school boyfriend for him and never looked back. Were there really other guys, other hands held in darkened movie theaters? Or, more realistically&#x2014;since she was in college when they married&#x2014;frat boys at keg parties? Basketball players? Or did she just like thinking of herself as someone who kept her options open?

Their goal was California, and ahead of them lay 3,250 miles of dirt, mud, rock, and sand. Sixty-two days later they arrived in San Francisco, having averaged just five miles an hour. Known as the First Transcontinental Motor Train, this trip was an adventure, a circus, a public relations coup, and a war game all rolled into one. As road conditions worsened, it also became a daily battle of sweat and labor, of guts and determination. <br><br><i>American Road</i> is the story of this incredible journey. Pete Davies takes us from east to west, bringing to life the men on the trip, their trials with uncooperative equipment and weather, and the punishing landscape they encountered. Ironically one of the participants was a young soldier named Dwight Eisenhower, who, four decades later, as President, launched the building of the interstate highway system. Davies also provides a colorful history of transcontinental car travel in this country, including the first cross-country trips and the building of the Lincoln Highway. This richly detailed book offers a slice of Americana, a piece of history unknown to many, and a celebration of our love affair with the road.<br></p><p>Pete Davies is the author of a number of critically acclaimed works of nonfiction, including <i>Inside the Hurricane</i> and <i>The Devil's Flu</i>. He lives in West Yorkshire, England.<br>In his newest book, Davies (Inside the Hurricane; The Devil's Flu) offers a play-by-play account of the 1919 cross-country military caravan that doubled as a campaign for the Lincoln Highway (so named for the one Republican the corporate leaders of the day figured most Americans would embrace). The potential here is extraordinary. Using the progress of the caravan and the metaphor of paving toward the future versus stagnating in the mud, Davies touches on the industrial and social factors that developed the small and mid-sized towns that line the highways and byways of the nation. But instead of allowing the story of the caravan to anchor a series of more engaging essays on the people, politics and development of the lands it connects, the author insists on a day-to-day narrative of breakdowns, muddy roads and ice cream socials (the convoy left just days after Prohibition became law). Officers attend fancy dinners, enlisted men "dance with local girls," and the arrival of two miles' worth of dusty and cantankerous machinery is the greatest moment in every life in every town. Eisenhower, a future military legend and U.S. president, makes an early cameo as a young, frustrated officer who takes part in the convoy in the hopes of reinvigorating a stalled army career. Even this little twist fails to engage the reader, as Ike becomes yet another faceless character in a tale paced not unlike the caravan it chronicles slow.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tyrannosaurus Drip</h2><p>Everyone knows that tyrannosauruses are big and scary, so when a placid duckbill dinosaur&#39;s egg ends up in the wrong nest confusion is sure to ensue.

The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food they served him tasted even worse when retched back up. Besides, why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. He sometimes heaved the wine up too, but there was always more. "The world is full of wine," he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father had never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He ought to know; he'd killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.<br><br> Below decks there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. "Is this Dornish wine?" Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. "It reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him."<br><br> The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. "Have I offended you?" Tyrion asked the sullen, silent boy, as he was scrubbing. "Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?"<br><br> That went unanswered too. This is pointless, he knew, but he must speak to someone or go mad, so he persisted. "Where are we sailing? Tell me that." Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. "Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?" Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.<br><br> Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He may clap me in chains instead, and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night's Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont may be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the Lord Commander. That butcher's son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.<br><br> The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. "Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?" the dwarf inquired. "Might that be where whores go?" Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.<br><br> The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester's knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities... well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they spea the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.<br><br> Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamt enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.<br><br> "Wherever whores go," his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father's bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.<br><br> Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose. That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, "I've killed my father," in the same tone a man might use to say, "I've stubbed my toe." The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. "You should not have climbed that ladder," he said reproachfully.<br><br> "Wherever whores go." Tyrion warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him. "I killed Shae too," he confessed to Varys.<br><br> "You knew what she was."<br><br> "I did. But I never knew what he was."<br><br> Varys tittered. "And now you do."<br><br> I should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman's sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime... no, better not to think of Jaime.<br><br> He found a fresh skin of wine instead, and sucked at it as if it were a woman's breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. He sucked until the wine was gone. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink.<br><br> Is this your vengeance, Father? Have the Father Above made you his Hand? "Such are the wages of the kinslayer," he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down<br><br> When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they'd come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet, and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was up crammed face first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid and hoisted him up. He could hear voices shouting as he was jounced along. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a sudden crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.<br><br> That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.<br><br> It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.<br><br> Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.<br><br> The fat man looked down and smiled. "A drunken dwarf," he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.<br><br> "A rotting sea cow." Tyrion's mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man's feet. They were in a long dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.<br><br> "You are insolent. I like that in a dwarf." When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. "Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?"<br><br> "Thirsty." Tyrion struggled to his knees. "And filthy."<br><br> The fat man sniffed. "A bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it." His host put the mallet and chisel aside. "My house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes."<br><br> And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.<br><br> The fat man made good on the promised bath, at least... though no sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep.<br><br> He woke naked on a goosedown featherbed so deep and soft it felt as if he were being swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock felt as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamberpot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.<br><br> The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung shudders open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.<br><br> Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo's blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.<br><br> Across the pool stood stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the bay shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea. He wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh. Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.<br><br> When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. "This is Pentos, yes?"<br><br> "Just so. Where else?"<br><br> Pentos. Well, it was not King's Landing, that much could be said for it. "Where do whores go?" he heard himself ask.<br><br> "Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from among my serving women. None will dare refuse you."<br><br> "Slaves?" the dwarf asked pointedly.<br><br> The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion fond remarkably obscene. "Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you." Illyrio gave a ponderous half-bow. "But now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session." He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. "Explore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here."<br><br> "Were? Have I gone somewhere?"<br><br> "Time enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?"<br><br> "Yes, my fat friend," Tyrion replied. He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. "Spice soldiers and cheese lords," his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, he would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I were gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father's belly.<br><br> A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father's guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong... though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts.<br><br> "Wherever whores go," he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.<br><br> The magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey's had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. At least they do not stink of vomit.<br><br> Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a pot boy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. "Good morrow to you, fair ladies," he said with a bow. "Do you perchance know where the who...</p><h2>Alone with the Past: The life and photographic art of Roland W. Reed</h2><p>ROLAND REED'S decision came at the last possible moment. By the dawn of the twentieth century, this country's Native Americans were living on reservations, their old ways of life unalterably changed. Royal W. (Roland) Reed, Jr. (1864-1934) was one of a small number of professional photographers now known as Pictorialists who set out to document this "vanishing" race. Employing new artistic techniques and often posing their subjects, the Pictorialists recreated the "noble savage" as they imagined them to have been in the past, not as they presently found them. Reed's better known contemporary, Edward Curtis, enjoyed broad backing and financial support for his work. Reed did not; his work was solitary, self-directed, and self-funded. Critics agree that Reed's photographs are equal, both technically and artistically, to those of Curtis, but his work has remained largely unknown and unpublished.<br> Reed lived with and photographed the Ojibwe in Minnesota; the Blackfeet, Piegan, Flathead, Cheyenne, and Blood in northern Montana and southern Canada; and the Navajo and Hopi in Arizona. He had begun work on the publication of his collection with the title Reed's Photographic Art Studies of the North American Indian at the time of his accidental death. This unfinished work is the genesis for ALONE WITH THE PAST, which realizes Roland Reed's dream.</p><p>Ernie Lawrence has had a lifelong interest in history, the American West, and photography. Prior to his retirement as a business executive, he spent more than twenty-five years as either CEO or COO of a number of different private-equity funded public and private businesses in a variety of industries. He is currently an Adjunct Professor at the Lubar School of Business, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he teaches graduate courses in Change Management.<br> Ernie holds a BA in English from St. John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, an MBA from the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado, and is a former Officer in the United States Army. He and his wife Jan have three grown daughters and six grandchildren and currently live in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin.</p><h2>King and Queen of the River : The Legendary Paddle-Wheel Steamboats Delta King and Delta Queen</h2><p>This is the remarkable story of paddle-wheel steamers Delta King and Delta Queen, California'slast and most beloved riverboats. Since moving to the Mississippi and Ohio over half a century ago, the Delta Queen has become the world's most famous steamboat. Born in the Roaring Twenties, these historic vessels carried passengers nightly between San Francisco and Sacramento from 1927 to 1940. They offered romantic overnight cruises with dining, dancing and jazz. After serving the U.S. Navy in World War II, they went their separate ways--the Queen through the Panama Canal to America's heartland and the King to Canada where for seven years it was stranded on dry ground. The Delta Queen found fame and fortune in her new life on rivers of the Midwest and South--and still operates there today. In sharp contrast, the Delta King suffered 40 years of hardship, gloom, heartbreak--with sinkings, landlocking, fires, and piracy. Finally, the King was restored at Sacramento as a beautiful floating hotel. This is truly a tale of "riches to rags to riches." Through lively interviews, anecdotes, photos, maps, and lyrical prose, King &amp; Queen of the River covers the unknown story of these legendary steamboats from the Roaring Twenties to the 1990s.</p><p>Upon taking early retirement from Sunset Magazine more than a decade ago, California-born author Stan Garvey went full-time researching the history of the famed Delta twins. After searching countless archives, reviewing hundreds of photos, and interviewing former crew members and scores of passengers from the boats&#39; vintage years, he spent four years writing the book. It&#39;s the definitive work on the Delta King and Delta Queen."Exceptionally well written ... an incredible story that has been waiting to be told for more than half a century." -- <i>Steamboat Journal</i><br><br>"It will soon be known as the definitive work on the subject." -- <i>Steamboat Bill</i><br><br>A wonderfully human story ... written in depth about a striking piece of Americana. -- <i>Karl Kortum, founder of San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park</i><br><br>Like the boats, this book is a treasure. -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>Little-revealed connections between two vintage riverboats are revealed in this rare examination of the Delta Queen and King: California steamboats which served in the war, then were separated. One needn't be a riverboat fan in order to appreciate this fine California history, which captures the romance and drama of early riverboat days and the paddle-wheel era. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>Probably the best existing re-creation of life and labor on the night boats. -- <i>George W. Hilton, Prof. Em. UCLA</i></p><h2>Godric</h2><p>In twelfth-century Britain, a humble merchant named Godric forsakes his business to make pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, later renouncing all his goods and possessions to adopt the life of a hermit</p><p>If you think a novel about a saint is likely to be a dry and airy sort of thing, think again. Godric was a 12th-century saint--born to Anglo-Saxon parents in Norfolk almost in the year of the Norman invasion (1066 for those of you long unschooled!). He was a peddler and wanderer long before he settled into the life of a hermit in northern England, led there by the famous hermit St. Cuthbert, who told him, "your true nesting place lies farther on, [and] until you reach it, every other place you find will fret you like a cage."<p> In <i>Godric</i> Frederick Buechner captures the voice and the times of this saint with a style that recalls the richly alliterative language of Middle English poetry. So too does it recall the beautiful earthiness of that literature, reminding us that this time of deep spirituality was also a time of real flesh-and-blood folk. And in some ways this is the deepest point of this delightful (and at times comic) novel: these people, like those who live among us today, become saints not by leaving the body behind but by finding a way to live more deeply within it. They find a way to turn it to glory. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>A brilliant re-creation of the sacred and profane life journey of the unpredictable, all-too-human twelfth-century saint who went from being a sea rover to poet, hermit, and mystic.</p><h2>Presence: An Exploration of Profound Change in People, Organizations, and Society</h2><p><p><i>Presence</i> is an intimate look at the development of a new theory about change and learning. In wide-ranging conversations held over a year and a half, organizational learning pioneers Peter Senge, C. Otto Scharmer, Joseph Jaworski, and Betty Sue Flowers explored the nature of transformational change&#x2014;how it arises, and the fresh possibilities it offers a world dangerously out of balance. The book introduces the idea of &#x201c;presence&#x201d;&#x2014;a concept&nbsp;borrowed from the natural world&nbsp;that the whole is entirely present in any of its parts&#x2014;to the worlds of business, education, government, and leadership. Too often, the authors found, we remain stuck in old patterns of seeing and acting. By encouraging deeper levels of learning, we create an awareness of the larger whole, leading to actions that can help to shape its evolution and our future.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on the wisdom and experience of 150 scientists, social leaders, and entrepreneurs, including Brian Arthur, Rupert Sheldrake, Buckminster Fuller, Lao Tzu, and Carl Jung,&nbsp;<i>Presence</i> is both revolutionary in its exploration and hopeful in its message.&nbsp;This astonishing and completely original work goes on to define the capabilities that underlie our ability to see, sense, and realize new possibilities&#x2014;in ourselves, in our institutions and organizations, and in society itself.</p></p><p><i>Presence</i> can be read as a both a guide and a challenge to leaders in business, education, and government to transform their institutions into powerful agents of change in a world increasingly out of balance. Since business is the most powerful institution in the world today, the authors argue, it must play a key role in solving global societal problems. Yet so many institutions seem to run people rather than the other way around. In this illuminating book, the authors seek to understand why people don't change systems and institutions even when they pose a threat to society, and examine why institutional change is so difficult to attain. <p> The authors view large institutions such as global corporations as a new species that are affecting nearly all other life forms on the planet. Rather than look at these systems as merely the extension of a few hyper-powerful individuals, they see them as a dynamic organisms with the potential to learn, grow, and evolve--but only if people exert control over them and actively eliminate their destructive aspects. "But until that potential is activated," they write, "industrial age institutions will continue to expand blindly, unaware of their part in a larger whole or of the consequences of their growth." For global institutions to be recreated in positive ways, there must be individual and collective levels of awareness, followed by direct action. Raising this awareness is what <i>Presence</i> seeks to achieve. Drawing on the insights gleaned from interviews with over 150 leading scientists, social leaders, and entrepreneurs, the authors emphasize what they call the "courage to see freshly"--the ability to view familiar problems from a new perspective in order to better understand how parts and wholes are interrelated. </p><p> This is not a typical business book. Mainly theoretical, it does not offer specific tips that organizational managers or directors can apply immediately; rather, it offers powerful tools and ideas for changing the mindset of leaders and unlocking the latent potential to "develop awareness commensurate with our impact, wisdom in balance with our power." <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p><b>Peter Senge</b> is a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the founding chair of SoL, a renowned pioneer, theorist, and writer in the field of management innovation, and the author of the widely acclaimed book, <i>The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization</i> (Doubleday/Currency, 1990). <b>C.

Wouldn't it be interesting to learn important information that could enhance your life, in both large and small ways? Did you know you have a guardian angel? Has anyone explained to you there are different foods that could benefit you? Wouldn't you like to purchase a fragrance that could make others take notice of you? Some types of music should be more relaxing for you than others. You even have your own special flower based on the day you were born. Would you like to know what your lucky numbers are? Which day of the week may be best to ask for a raise? Are you seeking a mate? This book will explain the best bets in selecting a life partner for you. The tiniest things may make a difference, no matter how insignificant they may seem to you. One color may be luckier for you than another, while another color may balance your mood and enhance your environment.<br>You can use this book to find out all of this information about yourself. Turn to the page with <i>your</i> birthday to learn how to have a happier, more productive life. For example, my birthday is July 27. By reading that page I'd learn that I need Orange in my environment when I feel weak, I look great in Plum, and Rubies will help me overcome disappointment in love. Using this book will help you unlock the keys to your personality, needs, motivations, and dreams. You can also look up the birthdays of friends and loved ones to help you understand them better, too.<br>You may notice that some information repeats itself over several days. That's because there are often similarities between people born around the same time of year. But each person has qualities that are all his or her own, and each day is as special as the person born on it.<br>Here is a list of the information you'll find in this book:<br><b>Gems:</b> These are jewels and precious stones that the ancients felt could be worn to bring the bearer luck, power, and encouragement. Use them carefully, as they can be powerful tools in managing your spiritual life.<br><b>Colors:</b> Many studies have shown that the colors we surround ourselves with can change our moods, so it's vital to select the correct combinations. We each have a color that enhances our confidence and calms us when we are troubled. According to research, there are colors that will actually make you feel better, especially if your home or workplace lacks them.<br><b>Apparel Colors:</b> There are hues and shades that are better and luckier for you to wear than others. They may give you more charm and charisma.<br><b>Astral Colors:</b> These colors are ones you may be naturally drawn to and that may benefit you throughout your life in many subtle ways. Listed is the one that is certain to help you find your place in the universe.<br><b>Trees:</b> Trees have the attributes of strength and power. They are full of life and offer individual meaning to each of us. You may be drawn to put a special tree in your yard or even have a memory of a certain tree when you were young. You may just look at one all the time and find that it is talking to you. See what yours might say. Once you know what tree belongs to you, you might look at and relate to your world differently.<br><b>Birds:</b> I bet you never realized how much birds and humans really do have in common. When you read the description of birds in this book, you may find in the characterization of the birds a fascinating resemblance to yourself. You may only then recognize that without a doubt you have an attraction to a particular bird.<br><b>Health Scents:</b> Besides finding out what to wear to smell good, you'll want to splash on what might make you feel good. There are scents that are relaxing and have better effects on particular sun signs. You may be naturally drawn to a scent because it relaxes you or you just love its smell. These scents have been selected for you for their mystical traits and ingredients.<br><b>What's Lucky:</b> What's more fascinating than knowing what "lucky" numbers, times, days, months, and years are yours, particularly if they were picked out according to the day you were born? Do you have a lucky charm? You can now. Each lucky charm has been chosen by either its number or sign and could prove to be more than a little beneficial for you. Picking a mate isn't easy, and neither is picking a partner. Maybe this advice could help.<br><b>Spiritual Stones:</b> These small bits of Mother Earth will guide you on your path over her. Use them in broadening your understanding of yourself or nature.<br><b>Judith's Insight:</b> I have been a professional psychic for eighteen years and, after much meditation and thought, have developed my own insights for each day of the year. You may notice that the traits of some days are similar to those that surround them; however, each is unique. You may be able to relate to one or two items right away, but -- as with the other items -- each time you come back to this book you may glimpse a different part of yourself. As the person reading the book changes, the messages will alter and shift. Each insight was written to hold some meaning for you at almost any stage of your life. However, don't expect that everything will make sense right away. For example, careers that may not even interest you today could give you great satisfaction a year or two from now. The insights offer you a peek not just into who you are but who you are capable of becoming. They are crafted to give you encouragement when you may need it. All the listed information is intended to help and guide you in making the right choices for you.<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 1999 by Judith Turner</p><h2>The Winchester Book</h2><p>IF THE PICTURE YOU SEE DOES NOT HAVE THE DUST JACKET SHOWN IT IS NOT THE BOOK YOU WILL GET FROM ME.

Wallach Professor of History at Columbia University. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Hitler&#x2019;s Empire</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Balkans: A Short History</i>, winner of the Wolfson Prize for History, among other books. He lives in New York City.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Andrew Nagorski Surveying Nazi Germany's conquests shortly after it invaded the Soviet Union, Hitler's minister of economics boasted: "Never before in the history of the world has there been such an economy to administer." Germany was indeed the master of most of Europe at that point, and its armies were marching quickly into Russia. But in Hitler's Empire, Columbia University historian Mark Mazower spells out how ill-prepared the Germans were for their string of early victories -- and how completely they botched the administration of their empire. Many histories have focused on Hitler's costly military mistakes, particularly on the Eastern Front. Mazower largely ignores the battlefields and focuses instead on the political, racial and economic policies of the Nazi conquerors. While many parts of this story have been told before, he painstakingly examines a huge body of evidence for insights into Nazi misrule. This hardly makes for light reading, but it allows him to present a compelling case, which was best summarized by a German general at the end of the war. Addressing his fellow POWs, Ferdinand Heim argued that the German war effort would have been doomed "even if no military mistakes had been made." The reason: Nazi articles of faith amounted to grotesque fantasies about how the New Order would function, and they couldn't possibly survive prolonged, or even relatively short, clashes with reality. Leaving morality aside, the Holocaust made no economic sense at a time when Germany was desperately short of workers. When Victor Brack, one of the officials charged with carrying out the Final Solution, suggested that between 2 and 3 million Jews could be sterilized and put to work rather than killed, Hitler wasn't interested. The German leader's plans for the rest of the people in the East were even more absurd in economic terms, since they involved the majority of the local inhabitants, not just minorities. Under Nazi doctrine, Germanization was the overarching goal, which meant eliminating as many non-Germans as possible and finding and elevating local Germans or bringing in new German settlers. But after Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939, 90 percent of the inhabitants of German-occupied territory were Poles and only 6 percent ethnic Germans. And as the empire grew, the proportions of ethnic Germans became even smaller. In the midst of a widening conflict, German officials methodically photographed and examined Polish families, discriminating in favor of those who appeared to have "the soundest German blood." All of which was guaranteed to stir resentment. Even Colonel-General Johannes von Blaskowitz, one of the German commanders in Poland, noted: "The idea that one can intimidate the Polish population by terrorism and rub their noses in the dirt will certainly prove false." Nowhere was that miscalculation more costly than in the Soviet Union. After Stalin's purges and forced collectivization of the 1930s, some Ukrainians, Lithuanians and even Russians were prepared to view any invaders as possible saviors. Hitler's ruthless policies, directed not just against Jews but also against Soviet POWs and the entire civilian population, quickly disabused them of such notions. That part of the story is fairly well-known. But Mazower goes one step further by demonstrating the hypothetical alternative. He points to the relatively enlightened occupation of southern Ukraine and Odessa. In the port city, locals could open businesses if they offered the right bribes, and visiting Germans were astonished by the thriving shops, restaurants and cafes -- all with plenty of food. "It simply showed what could have happened across the former Soviet territories," Mazower writes, "if the Germans had allowed markets to flourish and not planned to destroy the social order." Ironically, the industrialized economies of Western Europe, where German rule was far less draconian than in the East, contributed more to the German war effort than the Eastern territories did. By deliberately starving their Eastern subjects, the Germans only contributed to the poor performance of the agricultural sector. And yet it was the East that mesmerized Hitler, whose whole notion of Lebensraum was built on the premise that Germany would harvest great riches there, using largely mythic German settlers. There simply weren't anywhere near the number of Germans needed to transform those fantasies into reality. At times, Mazower's sweeping survey feels forced, trying to cover everything -- the origins of Nazism, the Holocaust, collaboration and resistance in all parts of occupied Europe. Inevitably, there are some questionable generalizations. In explaining the Nazi New Order, Mazower asserts, "the quest to unify Germans within a single German state" was more important than anti-Semitism or than the lust for conquest -- as if these are contradictory impulses. But all the way through, Mazower offers incisive details and insights that make Hitler's Empire a fascinating read. He points out, for example, that the United States accounted for 67 percent of the world's oil output in 1943 and the Soviet Union only 10 percent. So here, too, Hitler's basic assumptions about what he would gain by conquering the East were flawed: Even if his armies had taken the oil fields in the Caucasus, he wouldn't have solved his energy problem. Luckily for Germany's opponents, the master race was totally impervious to something as mundane as logic. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Now that he was accompanied by the policeman, the workman was able to look at them more calmly. He noticed the woman first. She lay with her face looking up at the sky. Her eyes were closed but her mouth, partly open, revealed her white teeth. Her face was slightly flushed. Underneath a gray coat she wore a brick-colored kimono; the white collar was slightly open at the neck. The folds of the kimono were neatly arranged and she lay in a very orderly manner. The skirt ends of the kimono, fluttering in the wind, exposed the yellow lining. There were clean white socks on her feet, which lay primly aligned. Her clothes were not soiled. Nearby lay her sandals, also neatly arranged. The workman looked over at the man. His head was turned sideways. His face also appeared flushed, almost the face of a living person. He looked as if he had been drinking and had fallen asleep. The cuffs of his brown trousers showed from under a dark blue overcoat and his feet, in a pair of black shoes, were carelessly extended. The shoes were brightly polished; the socks were blue, with red stripes. The bodies lay quite close together. <p>Small crabs were scurrying in and out of cracks in the rocks.

He argues convincingly that the deepest needs of human personality -- security and significance -- ultimately cannot be satisfied by a marriage partner. We need to turn to the Lord, rather than our spouse, to satisfy our needs. This frees both partners for &#39;soul oneness,&#39; a commitment to minister to our spouse&#39;s needs rather than manipulating them to meet our own needs. With &#39;soul oneness&#39; comes renewed &#39;body oneness,&#39; where couples enjoy sexual pleasure as an expression and outgrowth of a personal relationship. The Marriage Builder also identifies three building blocks essential to constructing marriage: the grace of God, true marriage commitment, and acceptance of one&#39;s mate.

Bill s creations deliver exceptional taste and are written for the home baker. --Daniel Boulud"<br><br>Starred Review. A must-have for all serious bakers and the only book those with a passing interest in baking will ever need. "<br><br>For the past thirty years, Bill Yosses has gained a quiet, unsurpassed celebrity among chefs and pastry enthusiasts. The Perfect Finish is the summation of that career, and it s the most impressive homage to baking I've seen in a long time. It s beautiful a testament to his flawless artistry. It s practical organized to suit both the spontaneous and the occasion-specific baker. And it s wise full of Bill s unimpeachable skill and knowledge. It s perfect, really an accomplishment that would be remarkable, were it not so predictable. --Dan Barber, Blue Hill"<br><br>Bill Yosses knows how to rise to an occasion. If it is a State Dinner or a simple supper he knows exactly the sweet note it should end on. The Perfect Finish represents Bill s generosity perfectly and shares with the reader a lifetime repertoire of clever tricks and techniques in the pastry kitchen. --Alice Waters, Chez Panisse"<br><br>The Perfect Finish passes my first test for a cookbook, which is: Does it make me daydream about the dinner party (or brunch) at which I ll serve these recipes? In this case, the yes! came from the retro-fabulous Bouley banana-chocolate tart, which derives its cleverness from fruit caramelized with lime juice. Or maybe it was the creme-fraiche pancakes, the chocolate-caramel tart with sea salt or the chocolate-chunk cookies goosed with Nutella.... Their useful tips...make cooking from this book a reassuring experience, like having a fairy godmother in the kitchen. I hope the Obama girls are taking notes. "<br><br>I had the honor and pleasure of working with Bill Yosses many years ago as young chefs at the Polo Restaurant in New York City needless to say, he has achieved so much since our early days together. His current work The Perfect Finish lives up to his reputation of being in the forefront in the world of pastry today. His interpretation of classic American desserts is timeless in its simplicity and execution. --Thomas Keller, The French Laundry"</p><h2>Coaching for Performance: GROWing Human Potential and Purpose - The Principles and Practice of Coaching and Leadership, 4th Edition</h2><p><br>Over 500,000 copies sold.

He has written five books on sports, leadership and coaching of which Coaching for Performance is the best known, having been translated into over 20 different languages.<b>"Whitmore has ensured that the book will remain the leading text in its field. The layout makes reading the book pleasurable and greatly assists in appreciating its content.</b> <p>The book falls into four sections. The first introduces the principles of coaching and shows it as a way of managing, an attitude of mind rather than a tool to effect a one-off change. The second section and core of the book deals with the practices of coaching. The approach taken is wide-ranging and usefully includes team coaching. Ideas drawn from management development are interwoven with coaching methodologies drawn from the social sciences. </p><p>The third section is devoted to leadership for high performance. Leadership in the world today calls for pride of place in a book on management coaching. <b>Whitmore achieves in a few pages what full works on leadership often fail to reach - an understanding of the subject and sound advice on sowing the seeds to develop the skills to lead others.</b> </p><p>The final section looks at emotional intelligence (EI) and the tools of transformational psychology.

Although I was overweight, I had gotten along fine and had no health problems. But I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane....But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys&#x2014;and not men of my age&#x2014;required me to lose at least eighty pounds....I did not think that it was possible to lose so much weight in one year....[But] in fact, it took me exactly thirteen months." <br> &#x2014;Karl Lagerfeld <br><br> "Karl Lagerfeld&#x2019;s case is spectacular as it shows how it is possible, through determination and willpower, to return to a harmonious balance even when excess weight is of a long-standing, deeply ingrained nature. I hope that many will be inspired by the example of the slimmed-down, elegant, and indefatigable Karl Lagerfeld to lose either the few pounds they feel should be sacrificed for their happiness or the several dozen pounds that are detrimental to their survival." <br> &#x2014;Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret<br><br><i><b>The Karl Lagerfeld Diet</b></i>, developed exclusively for Karl Lagerfeld by Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret, reveals the secret techniques of Lagerfeld&#x2019;s amazing weight loss regimen. By first addressing the mental and behavioral causes of varying degrees of obesity, this book provides valuable insights and useful tips for preparing the mind and developing the willpower necessary to commit to this diet. <br><br> It then provides one hundred twenty gourmet recipes devised by Dr. Houdret, which cover breakfast, soups, starters and salads, eggs, seafood and fish, meat, pasta and pizza, vegetables, sauces, and desserts. Topping it off, Lagerfeld provides his personal tips for staying slim, attractive, and fit with additional chapters on skin care procedures, cosmetic treatments and surgery, general medical care, stress management, giving up tobacco, sleep, and exercise. Both an instructional guide and a motivational coach, <b><i>The Karl Lagerfeld Diet</i> </b>is the ultimate accessory for healthy living.</p><p>Karl Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg in 1939. He is a clothes designer, photographer, publisher, bookseller, and gallery owner. In 1996, he was awarded the "Prix culturel" by the German Photographic Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft fï¿½r Photographie). Lagerfeld lives in Paris. <p>Dr. Jean-Claude Houdret is a general practitioner specializing in nutrition, aesthetics, herbal medicine, and homeopathy. He teaches medicine at the University of Paris 13 and is the author of several books, he lives and works in Paris.</p>Famed couturier Lagerfeld was determined to lose weight, not because he was obese or suffered from health problems, but because he wanted to wear clothes designed for younger, slimmer men. His vanity paid off: he lost 80 pounds in a year on the "Spoonlight program." The three phases of the Paris general practitioner Houdret's regime are not exactly groundbreaking&#x2014;they involve limited calorie intake; no refined, fatty or fried foods; and an emphasis on lean proteins and fresh vegetables. The bulk of the book provides no-nonsense yet elegant (read: French) recipes for approved dishes, rated according to the diet's different phases. So far so good, yet some later sections seem incongruous, especially the ones where Lagerfeld and Houdret discuss face-lifts, and the chapter on exercise is rather strange ("If you really want to change the look of your breasts, you will need cosmetic surgery. To tone them, sprinkle them with cold water every morning and perform the following exercises"). The book is really a hybrid art book/diet manual, and its best chance for success stateside (it has sold nearly 200,000 copies worldwide) may lie in the former. For it appears certain aspects of this diet have been lost in translation. Photos. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But in the last thousand years six races have begun resettling Jijo, embracing a pre-industrial life to hide their existence from the Galactics. Overcoming their differences, the Six have built a society based on mutual tolerance for one another and respect for the planet they live on. But that has all changed with an event the Six have feared for hundreds of years: the arrival of an outside ship. Author David Brin has returned to his popular Uplift universe in this, the first book of a new trilogy.Once, millennia ago, the advanced Buyur civilization held sway on Jijo. But eventually the Buyur abandoned the world, leaving it to lie fallow and restore its ecological balance. Ever since, the vast civilization of the Five Galaxies has used patrols, guardian machines, and sanctions of law to prevent resettlement on Jijo until the planet has been revitalized. But over the centuries it has been resettled. Groups of sentient beings, fleeing persecution or neglect, have ignored the laws, evaded the patrols, and settled on Jijo. They now live in hiding, in dread of the &#34;Judgment Day&#34; on which the Five galaxies discover their presence on Jijo and bring punishment upon them. Then a strange ship arrives in Jijo&#39;s skies, and the uneasy peace is shattered.</p><h2>The Prophet Outcast: Trotsky 1929-1940</h2><p>Few political figures of the twentieth century have aroused as much controversy as the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Trotsky&#x2019;s extraordinary life and extensive writings have left an indelible mark on revolutionary conscience, yet there was a danger that his name would disappear from history. Originally published in 1954, Deutscher&#x2019;s magisterial three-volume biography was the first major publication to counter the powerful Stalinist propaganda machine. In this definitive biography Trotsky emerges in his real stature, as the most heroic, and ultimately tragic, character of the Russian Revolution.<br><br>This third volume of the trilogy, first published in 1963, is a self-contained narrative of Trotsky&#x2019;s years in exile and of his murder in Mexico in 1940. Deutscher&#x2019;s masterful account of the period, and of the ideological controversies ranging throughout it, forms a background against which, as he says, &#x2018;the protagonist&#x2019;s character reveals itself, while he is moving towards catastrophe.&#x2019;</p><p><b>Isaac Deutscher</b> was born in 1907 near Krakow and joined the Polish Communist Party, from which he was expelled in 1932. He then moved to London where he died in 1967. His other books include <i>Stalin</i> and <i>The Unfinished Revolution</i>.&#x201c;In the 1930s, Trotsky, with a handful of followers, attempted to block the path of Stalin&#x2019;s relentless hurricane of betrayal and murder. His epic defence of the soul of the Revolution against its bureaucratic executioners was a torchlight in the storm. In one of the very greatest modern biographies, Isaac Deutscher redeems the legacy of this astonishing revolutionary and humanist thinker.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mike Davis<br><br>&#x201c;The three volumes of Isaac Deutscher&#x2019;s life of Trotsky ... were for me the most exciting reading of the year. Surely this must be counted among the greatest biographies in the English language.&#x201d;&#x2014;Graham Greene<br><br>&#x201c;He has told the story more accurately and with fuller detail than ever before ... .compulsory reading for anyone interested in the history of Soviet Russia.&#x201d;&#x2014;A.J.P Taylor, <i>New Statesman</i><br><br>&#x201c;He has told the story more accurately and with fuller detail than ever before.

S. Lewis comes this fascinating work of historical fiction from the mind of Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Readers of the scriptures have long marveled at the account of the city of Enoch and its translation. What was their society like? Suppose ancient records had been kept and were made available to us today. What lessons might they contain? Elder Neal A. Maxwell tells the story of Enoch&#x2019;s ministry and the glory of his Christ-centered society through the eyes of a man called Mahijah, who urges his friend Omner to move to Zion before it&#x2019;s too late. Mahijah&#x2019;s imaginary letters provide a vivid portrayal of life in the city of Enoch, whose inhabitants the Lord called Zion, &#x201c;because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness&#x201d; (Moses 7:18). (Previously published under the title Of One Heart.)</p><p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who previously served as executive vice president at the University of Utah and as Commissioner of Education for the LDS Church, was sustained as an Assistant to the Twelve in 1974 and called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1981. A well-beloved speaker and author, he wrote thirty books, including All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience; Not My Will, But Thine; The Promise of Discipleship; and Moving in His Majesty and Power. Elder Maxwell passed away July 21, 2004. He and his wife, Colleen, have four children and twenty-four grandchildren.</p><h2>The Haw Lantern</h2><p>Poems exploring the theme of loss, meditations on the conscience of the writer, and exercises in an allegorical vein are featured in this collection of thirty-one poems</p><p>Seamus Heaney describes the haw lantern as "small light for small people" but there is more than tiny illumination emanating from one of Ireland's premier poets. Heaney peppers this short collection of poems with crafty language and natural objects: "I heard the hatchet's differentiated/Accurate cut, the crack, the sigh/And collapse of what luxuriated/Through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all." <i>The Haw Lantern</i> won England's Whitbread Prize in 1987.Seamus Heaney was born in County Derry in Northern Ireland. Death of a Naturalist, his first collection of poems, appeared in 1966 and since then he has published poetry, criticism and translations - including Beowulf (1999) - which have established him as one of the leading poets now at work. In 1995 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. District and Circle was awarded the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2006. Stepping Stones, a book of interviews conducted by Dennis O&#39;Driscoll, appeared in 2008. In 2009 he received the David Cohen Prize for Literature. Human Chain was awarded the 2010 Forward Prize for Best Collection.</p><h2>52 Loaves: One Man&#39;s Relentless Pursuit of Truth, Meaning, and a Perfect Crust</h2><p>William Alexander is determined to bake the perfect loaf of bread. He tasted it long ago, in a restaurant, and has been trying to reproduce it ever since. Without success. Now, on the theory that practice makes perfect, he sets out to bake peasant bread every week until he gets it right. He bakes his loaf from scratch. And because Alexander is nothing if not thorough, he really means from scratch: growing, harvesting, winnowing, threshing, and milling his own wheat.<br> &nbsp;<br> An original take on the six-thousand-year-old staple of life, <i>52 Loaves</i> explores the nature of obsession, the meditative quality of ritual, the futility of trying to re-create something perfect, our deep connection to the earth, and the mysterious instinct that makes all of us respond to the aroma of baking bread.<br><br></p><p><p>William Alexander, the author of two critically acclaimed books, lives in New York's Hudson Valley. By day the IT director at a research institute, he made his professional writing debut at the age of fifty-three with a national bestseller about gardening, <i>The $64 Tomato.</i> His second book, <i>52 Loaves,</i> chronicled his quest to bake the perfect loaf of bread, a journey that took him to such far-flung places as a communal oven in Morocco and an abbey in France, as well as into his own backyard to grow, thresh, and winnow wheat. The <i>Boston Globe</i> called Alexander "wildly entertaining," the <i>New York Times</i> raved that "his timing and his delivery are flawless," and the <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i> observed that "the world would be a less interesting place without the William Alexanders who walk among us." A 2006 Quill Book Awards finalist, Alexander won a Bert Greene Award from the IACP for his article on bread, published in <i>Saveur</i> magazine. A passion bordering on obsession unifies all his writing. He has appeared on NPR's <i>Morning Edition</i> and at the National Book Festival in Washington DC and is a frequent contributor to the<i> New York Times</i> op-ed pages, where he has opined on such issues as the Christmas tree threatening to ignite his living room and the difficulties of being organic. Now, in <i>Flirting with French,</i> he turns his considerable writing talents to his perhaps less considerable skills: becoming fluent in the beautiful but maddeningly illogical French language.&nbsp;<br></p>"Nitpicking Obsessiveness was never so appetizing." <br>--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Grade A-<br><br> (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>"Laugh out loud funny . . .

Twilight of the Gods was originally written in Swedish, and published in Buenos Aires shortly after the end of WWII. Erik Wallin, a Swedish soldier who volunteered for service with the Waffen-SS, and participated in the climactic battles on the Eastern Front during late 1944 and 1945, later telling his story to this book's editor, Thorolf Hillblad.<br><br>Wallin served with the Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion, 11th SS-Panzergrenadier Division Nordland, a unit composed mainly of non-German volunteers, including Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. The division enjoyed a high reputation for its combat capability, and was always at the focal points of the fighting on the Eastern Front in the last year of the war. During this period it saw combat in the Baltic, in Pomerania, on the Oder, and finally in defense of Berlin, where it was destroyed.<br><br>Erik Wallin served with his unit in all of these locations, and provides the reader with a fascinating glimpse into these final battles. The book is written with a 'no holds barred' approach which will captivate, excite and maybe even shock the reader - his recollections do not evade the brutality of fighting against the advancing Red Army. Twilight of the Gods is destined to become a classic memoir of the Second World War.</p><p>Thorolf Hillblad is an editor specializing in German military history.

Completely cut off from the outside world for seven months, he traveled nearly 1,500 miles with small bands of nomadic hunters known as Penan. Beneath the rain forest canopy, they trekked through a hauntingly beautiful jungle where snakes and frogs fly, pigs climb trees, giant carnivorous plants eat mice, and mushrooms glow at night. <br><br>At once a modern classic of travel literature and a gripping adventure story, <b>Stranger in the Forest</b> provides a rare and intimate look at the vanishing way of life of one of the last surviving groups of rain forest dwellers. Hansen's absorbing, and often chilling, account of his exploits is tempered with the humor and humanity that prompted the Penan to take him into their world and to share their secrets.</p><p>Eric Hansen lives in San Francisco, California.Hansen's adventurous walk across Borneo took place in the 1980s, but the forest and culture that he encountered have changed little during the past century. Though he documents his reactions to isolation and to the tropical forest environment and its culture, he is not successful in describing the indigenous people or the forest; a more sophisticated treatment would have enriched the reader's experience. Despite this weakness he conveys the drama of the adventure, not least his navete in undertaking such an effort with such little planning. James R.

Original.</p><p>Lisa Jewell worked in fashion and public relations, among other fields, before writing her first novel, <i>Ralph's Party</i>, which became an international bestseller.Like a fizzy cocktail, Jewell's follow-up to her bestselling Ralph's Party is quickly consumed and sometimes dizzying. Set in posh London, the plot adheres to the When Harry Met Sally formula of romantic comedyAtwo characters are unaware of their love for each other. Naturally, readers witness a string of calamities eventually resulting in a happy-ever-after ending. Dig Ryan and Nadine Kite, best friends for 15 years, have exhausted the dating market. Dig, who works for a small record label, wakes up on his 30th birthday with a 17-year-old girl in his bed, and suddenly feels old. He and Nadine, a 30-year-old freelance photographer, resolve to stop living as serial monogamists and find love with mature adults (to become, as Bridget Jones might say, Smug Marrieds). When Dig bumps into Delilah, the most beautiful girl in Holy Trinity high school and his first love, he thinks he may be lucky at last. Nadine is anything but happy at the reappearance, since Delilah, who has come to London without her husband, stole Dig from her once before. Meanwhile, Nadine has contacted her first love, Phil, who's even more of a jerk now than he was a decade ago, except now he's an ex-con, too. Of course, the appealing couple known as Dig 'n' Deen finds its way out of this tangle before the novel's candied close. Jewell's keen observation of British pop culture is perhaps the best attribute of a book that is fun but never quite intoxicating, and which is burdened by an unimaginative cover.

During that time, the Revolution came closer to being lost than at any time in the previous half dozen. The British still held New York, Savannah, Wilmington, and Charleston; the Royal Navy controlled the seas; the states--despite having signed the Articles of Confederation earlier that year--retained their individual sovereignty and, largely bankrupt themselves, refused to send any money in the new nation's interest; members of Congress were in constant disagreement; and the Continental army was on the verge of mutiny.<br>William Fowler's <i>An American Crisis </i>chronicles these tumultuous and dramatic two years, from Yorktown until the British left New York in November 1783.

We'd just shared cappuccinos he'd made in the ridiculously expensive machine I'd bought on a whim three weeks earlier, and croissants he'd picked up on his way in from his five-mile run, the irony lost on him. His lean, hard body was a machine, never gaining weight without his express design. Unlike me. The very aroma of baked goods and my thighs start to expand.<br><br>They were warm, the croissants. And as I tried to resist, he sliced them open and slathered them with butter, then jam on top of that, left one eviscerated and gooey, waiting on the white plate. I fought the internal battle and lost, finally reaching for it. It was perfect&#x2014;flaky, melty, salty, sweet. And then&#x2014;gone.<br><br>"You're not a very good influence," I said, licking butter from my fingertips. "It would take over an hour on the elliptical trainer to burn that off. And we both know <i>that's</i> not going to happen." He turned his blue eyes on me, all apology.<br><br>"I know," he said. "I'm sorry." Then the smile. Oh, the smile. It demanded a smile in return, no matter how angry, how frustrated, how <i>fed up</i> I was. "But it was so good, wasn't it? You'll remember it all day." Was he talking about the croissant or our predawn lovemaking?<br><br>"Yes," I said as he kissed me, a strong arm snaking around the small of my back pulling me in urgently, an invitation really, not the good-bye that it was. "I will."<br><br>That's when I saw the bit of jam. I motioned that he should wipe his face. He was dressed for an important meeting. <i>Crucial</i> was the word he used when he told me about it. He peered at his reflection in the glass door of the microwave and wiped the jam away.<br><br>"Thanks," he said, moving toward the door. He picked up his leather laptop case and draped it over his shoulder. It looked heavy; I was afraid he'd wrinkle his suit, a sharp, expensive black wool affair he'd bought recently, but I didn't say so. Too mothering.<br><br>"Thanks for what?" I asked. Already I'd forgotten that I'd spared him from the minor embarrassment of going to an important meeting with food on his face.<br><br>"For being the most beautiful thing I'll see all day." He was an opportunistic charmer. Had always been that.<br><br>I laughed, wrapped my arms around his neck, kissed him again. He knew what to say, knew how to make me feel good. I <i>would</i> think about our lovemaking, that croissant, his smile, that one sentence all day.<br><br>"Go get 'em," I said as I saw him out of the apartment door, watched him walk to the elevator at the end of the short hallway. He pressed the button and waited. The hallway had sold us on the apartment before we'd even walked through the door: the thick red carpet, the wainscoting, and the ten-foot ceilings&#x2014;New York City prewar elegance. The elevator doors slid open. Maybe it was then, just before he started to move away, that I saw a shadow cross his face. Or maybe later I just imagined it, to give some meaning to those moments. But if it was there at all, that flicker of what&#x2014;Sadness? Fear?&#x2014;it passed over him quickly; was gone so fast it barely even registered with me then.<br><br>"You know I will," he said with the usual cool confidence. But I heard it, the lick of his native accent on his words, something that only surfaced when he was stressed or drunk. But I wasn't worried for him. I <i>never</i> doubted him. Whatever he had to pull off that day, something vague about investors for his company, there was no doubt in my mind that he'd do it. That was just him: What he wanted, he got. With a wave and a cheeky backward glance, he stepped into the elevator and the doors closed on him. And then&#x2014;gone.<br><br>"I love you, Izzy!" I thought I heard him yell, clowning around, as the elevator dropped down the shaft, taking him and his voice away.<br><br>I smiled. After five years of marriage, a miscarriage, at least five knock-'em-down, drag-'em-outs that lasted into the wee hours of the morning, hot sex, dull sex, good days, hard days, all the little heartbreaks and disappointments (and not-so-little ones) inevitable in a relationship that doesn't crash and burn right away, after some dark moments when I thought we weren't going to make it, that I'd be better off without him, and all the breathless moments when I was sure I couldn't even <i>survive</i> without him&#x2014;after all of that he didn't have to say it, but I was glad he still did.<br><br>I closed the door and the morning was under way. Within five minutes, I was chatting on the phone with Jack Mannes, my old friend and longtime agent.<br><br>"Any sign of that check?" The author's eternal question.<br><br>"I'll follow up." The agent's eternal reply. "How's the manuscript going?"<br><br>"It's...going."<br><br>Within twenty minutes, I was headed out for a run, the taste of Marc's buttery, raspberry-jam kiss still on my lips.<br>When he stepped onto the street, he was blasted by a cold, bitter wind that made him wish he'd worn a coat. He thought about turning around but it was too late for that. Instead he buttoned his suit jacket, slung the strap of his laptop bag across his chest, and dug his hands deep into his pockets. He moved fast on West Eighty-sixth Street toward Broadway. At the corner, he jogged down the yellow-tiled stairway into the subway station, was glad for the warmth of it even with the particularly pungent stench of urine that morning. He swiped his card and passed through the turnstile, waited for the downtown train.<br><br>It was past nine, so the crowd on the platform was thinner than it would have been an hour before. A young businessman kept alternately leaning over the tracks, trying to catch sight of the oncoming train lights, and glancing at his watch. In spite of the rich drape of his black wool coat, his expensive shoes, he looked harried, disheveled. Marcus Raine felt a wash of disdain for him, for his obvious tardiness, and for his even more obvious distress, though he couldn't have explained why.<br><br>Marcus leaned his back against the far wall, hands still in his pockets, and waited. It was the perpetual condition of the New Yorker to wait&#x2014;for trains, buses, or taxis, in impossibly long lines for a cup of coffee, in crowds to see a film or visit a particular museum exhibit. The rest of the world saw New Yorkers as rude, impatient. But they had been conditioned to queue one behind the other with the resignation of the damned, perhaps moaning in discontent, but waiting nonetheless.<br><br>He'd been living in this city since he was eighteen years old, but he never quite saw himself as a New Yorker. He saw himself more as a spectator at a zoo, one who'd been allowed to wander around inside the cage of the beast. But then he'd always felt that way, even as a child, even in his native home. Always apart, watching. He accepted this as the natural condition of his<br><br>life, without a trace of unhappiness about it or any self-pity. Isabel had always understood this about him; as a writer, she was in a similar position. <i>You can't really observe, unless you stand apart.</i><br><br>It was one of the things that first drew him to her, this sentence. He'd read a novel she'd written, found it uncommonly deep and involving. Her picture on the back of the jacket intrigued him and he'd searched her out on the Internet, read some things about her that interested him--that she was the child of privilege but successful in her own right as the author of eight bestselling novels, that she'd traveled the world and written remarkably insightful essays about the places she visited. "Prague is a city of secrets," she'd written. "Fairy-tale rues taper off into dark alleys, a secret square hides behind a heavy oak and iron door, ornate facades shelter dark histories. Her face is exquisite, finely wrought and so lovely, but her eyes are cool. She'll smirk but never laugh. She knows, but she won't tell." This was true in a way that no outsider could ever really understand, but this American writer caught a glimpse of the real city and it moved him.<br><br>It was the river of ink-black curls, those dark eyes, jet in a landscape of snowy skin, the turn of her neck, the birdlike delicacy of her hands, that caused him to seek her out at one of her book signings. He knew right away that <i>she was the one</i>, as Americans were so fond of saying&#x2014;as if their whole lives were nothing but the search to make themselves whole by finding another. He meant it in another way entirely, at first.<br><br>It seemed like such a long time ago, that initial thrill, that rush of desire. He often wished he could go back to the night they first met, relive their years together. He'd done so many wrong things&#x2014;some she knew about, some she did not, could never, know. He remembered that there was something in her gaze when she first loved him that filled an empty place inside him. Even with all the things she didn't understand, she didn't look at him like that anymore. Her gaze seemed to drift past him. Even when she held his eyes, he believed she was seeing someone who wasn't there. And maybe that was his fault.<br><br>He heard the rumble of the train approaching, and pushed himself off the wall. He'd started moving toward the edge when he felt a hand on his arm. It was a firm, hard grip and Marcus, on instinct, rolled his arm and broke the grasp, bringing his fist up fast and taking a step back.<br><br>"Take it easy, Marcus," the other man said with a throaty laugh. "Relax." He lifted two beefy hands and pressed the air between them. "Why so tense?"<br><br>"Ivan," Marcus said coolly, though his heart was an adrenaline-fueled hammer. The moment took on an unreal cast, the tenor of a dark fantasy. Ivan was a ghost, someone so deeply buried in Marcus's memory that he might as well have been looking at a resurrected corpse. Once a tall, wiry young man, manic and strange, Ivan had gained a lot of weight. Not fat but muscle; he looked like a bulldozer, squat and powerful, ready to break concrete and the earth itself.<br><br>"What?" That deep laugh again, with less amusement in its tone. "No 'How are you'? No 'So good to see you'?"<br><br>Marcus watched Ivan's face. The wide smile beneath cheekbones like cliffs, the glittering dark eyes&#x2014;they could all freeze like ice. Even jovial like this, there was something vacant about Ivan, something unsettling. It was so odd to see him in this context, in this life, that for a moment Marcus could almost believe that he was dreaming, that he was still in bed beside Isabel. That he'd wake from this as he had from any of the nightmares that plagued him.<br><br>Marcus still didn't say anything as his train came and went, leaving them alone on the platform. The woman in the fare booth read a paperback novel. Marcus could hear the rush of trains below, hear the hum and horns of the street above. Too much time passed. In the silence between them, Marcus watched Ivan's expression cool and harden.<br><br>Then Marcus let go of a loud laugh that echoed off the concrete and caused the clerk to look up briefly before she went back to her book.<br><br>"Ivan!" Marcus said, forcing a smile. "Why so tense?"<br><br>Ivan laughed uncertainly, then reached out and punched Marcus on the arm. Marcus pulled Ivan into an enthusiastic embrace and they patted each other vigorously on the back.<br><br>"Do you have some time for me?" Ivan asked, dropping an arm over Marcus's shoulder and moving him toward the exit. Ivan's gigantic arm felt like a side of beef, its weight impossible to move without machinery. Marcus pretended not to hear the threat behind the question.<br><br>"Of course, Ivan," Marcus said. "Of course I do."<br><br>Marcus heard a catch in his own voice, which he tried to cover with a cough. If Ivan noticed, he didn't let on. A current of foreboding cut a valley from his throat into his belly as they walked up the stairs, Ivan still holding on tight. He was talking, telling a joke about a hooker and a priest, but Marcus wasn't listening. He was thinking about Isabel. He was thinking about how she looked this morning, a little sleepy, pretty in her pajamas, her hair a cloud of untamed curls, smelling like honeysuckle and sex, tasting like butter and jam.<br><br>On the street, Ivan was laughing uproariously at his own joke and Marcus found himself laughing along, though he had no idea what the punch line had been. Ivan knew a lot of jokes, one more inane than the last. He'd learned a good deal of his English this way, reading joke books and watching stand-up comedians, insisted that one could not really understand a language without understanding its humor, without knowing what native speakers considered funny. Marcus wasn't sure this was true. But there was no arguing with Ivan. It wasn't healthy. The smallest things caused a switch to flip in the big man. He'd be laughing one minute and then the next he'd be beating you with those fists the size of hams. This had been true since they were children together, a lifetime ago.<br><br>Ivan approached a late-model Lincoln parked illegally on Eighty-sixth. With the remote in his hand he unlocked it, then reached to open the front passenger door. It was an expensive vehicle, one that Ivan would not have been able to afford given his circumstances of the last few years. Marcus knew what this meant, that he'd returned to the life that had gotten him into trouble in the first place.<br><br>Marcus could see the front entrance to his building, gleaming glass and polished wood, a wide circular drive. A large holiday wreath hung on the awning, reminding him that Christmas was right around the corner.<br><br>He watched as a young mother who lived there&#x2014;was her name Janie?&#x2014;left with her two small children. He found himself thinking suddenly, urgently, of the baby Isabel had wanted. He'd never wanted children, had been angry when Isabel got pregnant, even relieved when she miscarried. Somehow the sight of this woman with her little girls caused a sharp stab of regret. Marcus turned his face so that they wouldn't see him as they passed on the other side of the street.</p><h2>Buried Secrets: A True Story of Drug Running, Black Magic, and Human Sacrifice</h2><p>Describes the disappearance and brutal murder of a young American college student, Mark Kilroy, in Matamoros, Mexico, and the bizarre, drug-running cult responsible</p><p>Although others have written of the mass killings in Matamoros, Mexico, between 1985 and 1988, Pulitzer Prize winner Humes of the Orange County Register in California offers here the definitive study. Cult leader Adolfo Constanzo, a bisexual Cuban-American devoted to the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santeria and its black-magic offshoot Palo Mayombe, set himself up as a magician and fortune teller in Mexico City in the mid-'80s. Constanzo soon attracted disciples, who obeyed him out of either fear or love, and he saw that more money was to be made from drugs than from reading cards. As his involvement with the drug trade increased, so did the torture-murders he asserted were necessary to sustain his power. The kidnapping and ritual murder of American student Mark Kilroy eventually brought about his downfall; Constanzo was killed in a shoot-out and most of his chief followers sentenced to prison. Humes provides an extensive background examining Caribbean religions and pseudo-religions, the feuds between federal and local police in Mexico and between the DEA and customs officials in the U.S., and, most intriguingly, the power of superstition south of the border. One of the best true-crime tales in recent time. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.When Mark Kilroy, an American student on his spring break, disappeared in 1988 in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, an intensive search for him proved fruitless. However, a roadblock set up to catch drug smugglers led to the discovery of his mutilated body on an isolated ranch. He had been killed by a small group of believers in Palo Mayombe, an offshoot of the Santeria religion that merges Christianity and African magic. Believing that human sacrifice gave him a magical invincibility, Adolpho Constanzo, the cult's leader, used his malevolent magnetism to manipulate his followers into committing murder 24 times. Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Humes, with access to the records of the principals involved, Drug Enforcement Agency materials, and extensive interviews, has written a chilling story of murder and religous mania. Although extremely grisly in detail, this book will be in demand. Recommended.<br><i>- Sandra K.

Gathered from the archives of Eon Productions and published to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Bond movies and the release of the newest James Bond movie, <i>James Bond Movie Posters</i> depicts in hot type and bold color four decades of our favorite spy in action. Film-goers first encountered the trademark gun barrel logo on the poster for <i>Dr. No</i>, produced in 1962 to promote the first official Bond movie. Then followed the famous image of Bond with a gun across his chest on the poster for <i>From Russia with Love</i>, <i>Goldfinger</i>s startling golden girl, and the inimitable Pussy Galore. These images have become some of the most memorable visual teasers in cinematic history and are now one of the hottest items of memorabilia among both Bond aficionados and movie collectors. This collection features over 200 original posters, including posters that were never released, limited edition festival posters, and rare advance posters. They are all meticulously reproduced in this oversized, full-color paperback. "James Bond is back in action! Everything he touches turns to excitement!"</p><p>Tony Nourmand is the co-proprietor of the Reel Poster Gallery in London, the leading international film poster gallery, and is a top authority on the subject. In addition, he is the film poster consultant for Christie&#39;s and travels throughout the world in search of rare and desirable posters.On October 5, 1962, a god was born, for that day marked the release of Dr. No starring Sean Connery as super-cool British secret agent James Bond. To commemorate the film's 40th anniversary, Nourmand, co-proprietor of London's Reel Poster Gallery and a film poster consultant for Christie's, has collected the Bond series movie posters (more than 200), including lobby one-sheets, teaser posters for forthcoming releases, and some foreign versions dating from Dr. No to 1999's The World Is Not Enough. Each poster includes a caption detailing its background, a film plot synopsis, and special production notes (if any). There are also additional goodies such as festival posters, a spread of special artwork appearing in Esquire in the 1960s, and profiles of each artist. The style of these posters has changed over time, with the golden Connery and anemic Roger Moore years mostly utilizing paintings, while the short-lived Timothy Dalton era and current Pierce Brosnan ads are photo montages, although almost all feature Bond brandishing a pistol with some shapely babe in the background. Bond fans will love this book. Recommended.

Durham and brought up in Cumberland where he now lives quietly with his wife, Pat, and not so quietly with their labrador bitch and two Siamese cats. A full-time writer since 1980, he has written over forty books and won prizes for individual novels (including the Crime Writers' Association's prestigious Gold Dagger Award for Best Crime Novel of the Year for <i>Bones and Silence</i>) and for short stories. In 1995 he was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger for his lifetime contribution to crime-writing. He spent many years as a teacher in Yorkshire which provided the inspiration and setting for the novels featuring the Falstaffian figure of Andy Dalziel, Head of Mid-Yorkshire CID, and his more sensitive sidekick, Peter Pascoe, whose adventures in the detective trade have been the basis of one of the most satisfying novel sequences of the modem age. Their popularity has been carried over into the hugely successful BBC television series featuring Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan. The same qualities of style, pace, characterization and humour are evident in the books featuring his other series character, Joe Sixsmith, the likeable redundant lathe operator turned PI from Luton. Hill says he was delighted to win the Diamond Dagger because it finally confirmed he had made the right career choice and now he can really get down to it.</p><h2>The Rancher Takes a Wife</h2><p><b>Continue on the adventure with <i>The Rancher Takes a Wife</i>, the conclusion to Richmond Hobson's western frontier trilogy!<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interior of British Columbia in the early 20th century is a jungle of swamps, rivers, and grasslands. It's a vast and still barely explored wilderness, whose principal citizens are timber wolves, moose, giant grizzly bears, and the odd human being. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into this forbidding land, Rich Hobson, Pioneer cattle rancher, brings Gloria, his city-raised bride. Her adjustment to life in the wilderness is sure to be difficult, as is her relationship with Rich and his backwoods cronies. Will Gloria find that she belongs in this strange, harsh land? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Told with wit and wisdom, Hobson recounts a wild true adventure story in the last book of his collection of survival tales.

He and his business partner, Panhandle "Pan" Phillips, moved to the interior of British Columbia and established the Frontier Cattle Company in the 1930s.

In a long series of vignettes, Pratt chronicles her Southern youth, during which she was "trained into the cult of pure white womanhood" and raised to be subjugated by a man; her lengthy marriage, the birth of two sons, and her eventual leave-taking from that traditional role; her coming out, living as a lesbian, and the fear it brought of "a sisterhood based on biological definitions" ; and--at the book's pulsing, erotic core--her passionate love for a woman born female but male in gender expression, who often lives as a man and whom Pratt calls "my husband." Some straights and gays alike may be repulsed by Pratt, finding her neither a "real woman" nor a "real lesbian." Others may applaud her efforts to eradicate boundaries. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Between Time &amp; Timbuktu, or, Prometheus-5: A Space Fantasy</h2><p>Space fantasy based on the works of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Illustrated with photos from the NET Playhouse production.</p><p></p><h2>The Lemonade Trick</h2><p>When Kerby adds a magic chemical to a pitcher of lemonade, the people who drink it are strangely affected</p><p></p><h2>Cooking the Costco Way : Across the Country and Around the World</h2><p>Colorful cookbook of recipes from the different regions in the United States and from different countries of the World such as Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan.</p><p></p><h2>The Stuff of Legend, Book 1: The Dark</h2><p>&nbsp;<br>The year is 1944. As Allied forces fight the enemy on Europe&#x2019;s war-torn beaches, another battle begins in a child&#x2019;s bedroom in Brooklyn. When the nightmarish Boogeyman snatches a boy and takes him to the realm of the Dark, the child&#x2019;s playthings, led by the toy soldier known as the Colonel, band together to stage a daring rescue. On their perilous mission they will confront the boy&#x2019;s bitter and forgotten toys, as well as betrayal in their own ranks. Can they save the boy from the forces of evil, or will they all perish in the process? <b>The Stuff of Legend</b> is a haunting and ultimately redemptive tale of loyalty, camaraderie, and perseverance.<br><br>This edition includes a brand-new story featuring the Colonel&#x2019;s war journal, maps, sketches, and other original material!</p><p>Mike Raicht&nbsp;spent four years as an editor at Marvel Comics.

He currently resides in New Jersey as a staff artist for Tell-A-Graphics while working on projects such as The Stuff of Legend and Vigilante Granny.In this eerie graphic novel, toys come to life to defend their "boy." The said boy lives in Brooklyn in 1944; early in the story the Boogeyman nabs him from his room. His toys, including a lead soldier, a ballerina, an Indian, a piggy bank, a wooden duck, a jack-in-the-box, and a stuffed bear, as well as his puppy, band together to venture into the realm of the Dark to rescue him. There they fight not only the Boogeyman but other toys that have joined forces with evil. Despite the prominent role of playthings, this is not a book for children, at least not young ones. The plot takes some dark turns, and there is a sometimes ugly psychological tension even between allies. The taut, suspenseful story will engross older readers, however. Wilson's lovely sepia artwork infuses the book with an ominous feel and brings the complex emotions of the living toys to the fore. The volume gathers issues one and two of The Stuff of Legend comic, published by Th3rd World Studio, along with character sketches, a new story revolving around the soldier's war journal, and character sketches. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His small size makes him an easy target for bullies and baddies and this little &#x201c;mouse&#x201d; always needs a place to hide. When he is befriended by Hok and Ying, he thinks he has found a new family, and eagerly tags along as they continue on their travels. What he doesn&#x2019;t know is that his new friends are the most wanted criminals in China, and their adventures will land him in the middle of a battle not only for their lives, but for the future of China itself.<br><br>As the characters rush towards a dramatic conclusion to the Five Ancestors series in this, the penultimate title, Jeff Stone has again created a marvelous story, a compelling voice, and a ton of exciting action.</p><p>Jeff Stone practices the martial arts daily. He has worked as a photographer, an editor, a maintenance man, a technical writer, a ballroom dance instructor, a concert promoter, and a marketing director for companies that design schools, libraries, and skateboard parks. Like the heroes of The Five Ancestors series, Mr. Stone was adopted when he was an infant. He began searching for his birthmother when he was 18; he found her 15 years later. The author lives with his wife and two children in Carmel, IN.The Chinese junk pitched and rolled in the pounding surf, its ancient timbers groaning under the heavy load. The boat lay low in the water, cold spray blowing over its rails with each gust of the frigid autumn wind. Hidden below a tattered tarpaulin on deck, ShaoShu&#x2014;Little Mouse&#x2014;wondered what he&#x2019;d gotten himself into.<br><br>He shivered. The damp sea air had soaked through his thin skin, deep into his tiny bones. He had only been aboard one day, but he already yearned to have his feet back on dry land.<br><br>ShaoShu had little experience on the water. True, he&#x2019;d just spent more than a week traveling down the Grand Canal with his new friends, Hok and Ying, but that ride was nothing like this one. That was fun. This was agonizing. The sooner he was off this ship, the better.<br><br>The boat lurched suddenly on the choppy seas, and a wicked crosswind lifted one corner of the tarp. ShaoShu quickly snatched it back down, catching a glimpse of General Tonglong&#x2019;s long ponytail braid swaying just a few paces away. ShaoShu shuddered. Tonglong&#x2014;the Mantis&#x2014;was uncomfortably close.<br><br>As a homeless street urchin, ShaoShu had a lifetime of practice hiding in small, inconspicuous places. He had an unnatural ability to bend and twist his small body into all sorts of strange shapes, and he put these skills to use stowing away here on Tonglong&#x2019;s Chinese man-o-war in order to steal some information for his new friends. This, however, had been more than he&#x2019;d bargained for. Perhaps he&#x2019;d pushed his luck too far.<br><br>ShaoShu shifted his position ever so slightly, and he felt the weight of the shiny cylindrical object resting on his lap. It was nothing really, some sort of spyglass. While it might prove useful to him, he had mainly taken it because it was made of a highly polished brass and glimmered with a luster he couldn&#x2019;t resist. It was this same fascination with shiny objects that had brought him to his current hiding place.<br><br>With each passing wave, ShaoShu sank deeper into the largest pile of treasure he&#x2019;d ever seen. He was surrounded by riches that even the Emperor would be hard-pressed to imagine: golden goblets, impossibly intricate jade figurines, mounds of pearl jewelry&#x2014; all of it piled here on the boat&#x2019;s deck and covered with a tarp like a worthless bale of straw. There were other piles, too, though none as large or magnificent as this one.<br><br>The treasure was connected to a series of dragon scrolls that contained secret dragon-style kung fu fighting techniques. One of the scrolls was also a map, and Tonglong had used it first to find Ying&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house, then to locate the treasure in a secret seaside cave. The cave was only accessible at low tide, and Tonglong had timed his arrival perfectly. In less than an hour, his men had stripped the cave of its contents. Now Tonglong was headed south to take care of what he called &#x201c;personal business.&#x201d;<br><br>ShaoShu didn&#x2019;t know what that business was, but he was certain he had already gathered plenty of information for Ying and Hok. The moment he saw an opportunity to sneak off the ship, he would make a break for it.<br><br>Having been aboard the better part of a day and a night, ShaoShu had learned the rhythms of the ship&#x2019;s watches. The laziest sailors were assigned to the watch that began at sunset, so that would be the best time to make his move. In the meantime, he would just have to wait.<br><br>From somewhere high above the deck, he heard a lookout shout, &#x201c;Sail ho!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; Tonglong asked, his metallic voice too close for ShaoShu&#x2019;s comfort.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a foreign sloop, sir,&#x201d; the lookout replied. &#x201c;By the shape of the stern and the rake of the mast, I&#x2019;d guess she&#x2019;s Dutch-built. Single mast with a reefed mainsail and a storm jib set taut. She&#x2019;s fast, sir, and sailed by seasoned seamen. No question about it, the way that rigging is set. She&#x2019;s off our stern, if you&#x2019;d like to have a look.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has anyone found my telescope yet?&#x201d; Tonglong roared.<br><br>No one replied.<br><br>Tonglong stormed across the deck. &#x201c;Whoever stole it will be strung up in the rigging for the birds to pluck out his eyes and feast on his liver!&#x201d;<br><br>Uh-oh, ShaoShu thought, silently taking Tong?long&#x2019;s spyglass off his lap and placing it on the treasure pile.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you see who&#x2019;s aboard?&#x201d; Tonglong called to the lookout.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, sir. Looks to be a bunch of children, if you can believe it. Four boys and a girl. At least, I think it&#x2019;s a girl. She&#x2019;s in a dress.&#x201d;<br><br>ShaoShu&#x2019;s heart leaped. That had to be Hok, along with some helpers! Maybe Ying was with her, too. ShaoShu had last seen Hok at the apothecary shop, and she must have figured out where he&#x2019;d gone. She was coming to rescue him! Hok and Ying were the smartest, kindest, bravest people he&#x2019;d ever met.<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like me to do, sir?&#x201d; someone asked Tonglong.<br><br>&#x201c;If they get close enough, blow them out of the water. People in this region need to learn to steer clear of me.&#x201d;<br><br>A large lump formed in ShaoShu&#x2019;s throat. He&#x2019;d forgotten about the gigantic qiangs, or cannons, as the sailors called them, lashed to the deck rails.<br><br>As he tried to decide what to do next, a quick darting movement caught ShaoShu&#x2019;s eye. He froze, and his nose twitched. He locked his gaze on the far side of the tarp and saw a small brown blur darting about close to the ground. A mouse! He couldn&#x2019;t believe his good luck.<br><br>ShaoShu relaxed, grateful for the company. He reached into the folds of his dirty robe and fished out the remains of a bean-paste bun he&#x2019;d swiped from a sailor earlier. ShaoShu dropped a few crumbs on the treasure pile around him and sat perfectly still. A moment later, the mouse scurried over, greedily consuming the sweet treat.<br><br>As the mouse was finishing its snack, ShaoShu gently held out a larger piece, away from his body. The small furry creature hurried over and began to nibble on ShaoShu&#x2019;s offering. ShaoShu smiled. He had always had good luck getting animals to come to him.</p><h2>JB Andrew: Mustang Magic (True Horse Stories)</h2><p>He was born, wild and free, in the vast mountainous scrublands of Nevada.

The New Yorker<br>The true story of a modern Robinson Crusoe and Huckleberry Finn, a homeless man and his erstwhile companion, a dog named Lizbeth, and their unbelievable, funny and poignant adventures on the road and on the streets.</p><p>Steinbeck, Eighner isn't--his stiff sentences and three-dollar words betray him--and Lizbeth is no Charley, either. But as a once- homeless gay writer who, with his dog, was down and out from Austin to Hollywood, Eighner has an unusual tale to tell nonetheless. Unfortunately, he's told the best part of it in ``On Dumpster Diving,'' an essay about living out of dumpsters that's included here but that's already reached a wide readership through its original publication in Threepenny Review and reprinting in nine periodicals and seven anthologies. A nifty bit of urban anthropology, it balances street savvy (``Candy...is usually safe if it has not drawn ants'') and pavement philosophy (``Once I was the sort of person who invests objects with sentimental value. Now I no longer have those objects, but I have the sentiments yet''). Here, it's embedded in the fortysomething author's account of his wanderings in the late 80's as he--after quitting a job at a mental hospital--tried to make it as a writer (mostly of gay, often erotic, fiction). The problem is that, as Eighner admits, ``Every life has trivial occurrences, pointless episodes, and unresolved mysteries, but a homeless life has...virtually nothing else.'' What's offered here, though, is mostly minutiae of Eighner's own homeless life: hunting for food, shelter, and rides; befriending this vagabond and that; gay couplings. Occasionally, Eighner soapboxes (e.g., contending that the number of homeless addicts is ``greatly overestimated'') or injects minor drama into his yarn (e.g., Lizbeth's capture by a dogcatcher--an incident that reveals cracks in the author's facade when he says that it allowed him to understand mass vengeance killings by lone gunmen). But for the most part, Eighner's story is a tedious one, told with little style. A more reliable memoir of homeless life than Joe Homeless's My Life on the Streets (1992)--but less revealing and gripping than Jennifer Toth's The Mole People (p. 924). -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>A writer of gay erotic fiction, Eighner first attracted the attention of the literary world when the Threepenny Review published "On Dumpster Diving," his essay on how to forage for food, clothing, and other items from dumpsters. That piece is included in this remarkable account of Eighner's three years of homelessness. After quitting his job at a state mental hospital and being evicted from his rented shack, Eighner embarked with his dog, Lizbeth, on an odyssey of hitchhiking from Texas to California and back and of struggling to live on Austin's inhospitable streets. Refusing to panhandle or steal and fiercely attached to Lizbeth (a bed at the Salvation Army would have meant putting her to sleep), he endured numerous misfortunes and indignities. At first, Eighner's wierd prose--stiff, with lots of big 19th-century words--is off-putting, but then his unique voice--part naif innocent, part eccentric fool--has the reader rooting for Eighner and Lizbeth.

In his youth he was a boundlessly energetic adventurer on the bustling West Coast&#x2014;by turns playing the role of hobo, sailor, prospector, and oyster pirate. He spent his brief life rapidly accumulating the experiences that would inform his acclaimed, best-selling books: <i>The Call of the Wild</i>, <i>White Fang</i>, and <i>The Sea Wolf</i>.<p> London was plagued by contradictions. He chronicled nature at its most savage, but wept helplessly at the deaths of his favorite animals. At his peak the highest-paid writer in America, he was nevertheless constantly broke. An irrepressibly optimistic crusader for social justice, he burned himself out at forty: sick, angry, and disillusioned, but leaving behind a voluminous literary legacy, much of it ripe for rediscovery.</p><p> In <i>Wolf</i>, award-winning author James L. Haley explores the forgotten Jack London&#x2014;at once a hard-living globetrotter and a man alive with ideas, whose passion for social justice roared until the day he died.

This book makes the case for keeping it Italian with recipes for sauces and soups as cooked in Italian homes today. There are authentic versions of such favorites as carbonara, bolognese, marinara, and Alfredo, as well as plenty of unusual but no less traditional sauces, based on roasts, ribs, rabbit, clams, eggplant, arugula, and mushrooms, to name but a few.</p><p>Anyone who cooks or eats pasta needs this book. The straightforward recipes are easy enough for the inexperienced, but even professional chefs will grasp the elegance of their simplicity.</p><p>Cooking pasta the Italian way means:</p><ul><li>Keep your eye on the pot, not the clock.</li><li>Respect tradition, but don&#x2019;t be a slave to it.</li><li>Choose a compatible pasta shape for your sauce or soup, but remember they aren&#x2019;t matched by computer. (And that angel hair goes with broth, not sauce.)</li><li>Use the best ingredients you can find&#x2015;and you can find plenty on the Internet.</li><li>Resist the urge to embellish, add, or substitute. But minor variations usually enhance a dish.</li><li>How much salt? Don&#x2019;t ask, taste!</li></ul><p>Serving and eating pasta the Italian way means:</p><ul><li>Use a spoon for soup, not for twirling spaghetti.</li><li>Learn to twirl; never cut.</li><li>Never add too much cheese, and often add none at all.</li><li>Toss the cheese and pasta before adding the sauce.</li><li>Warm the dishes.Serve pasta alone. The salad comes after.</li><li>To be perfectly proper, use a plate, not a bowl.</li></ul><p>The authors are reluctant to compromise because they know how good well-made pasta can be.

It's a smart, honest, on-target kick-in-the-pants, guaranteed to rev your engines as you see how a few changes in your life, a few smart choices and strategic moves, can transform you from a run-of-the-mill rider into a GOOD one. How does Denny Emerson know what makes a good rider? For one thing, he IS one&#x2014;he is the only rider in the world to have won both a gold medal in international eventing and a Tevis Cup buckle in endurance. Plus, he's been around great riders, and taught those on their way to becoming great, for over 40 years. How will what Denny knows help YOU become a good rider? It's simple, really. He's boiled the whole thing down into seven broad "Areas of Choice" that collectively determine whether you are a "gonna be" or "you're going to get it done" or whether you'll be stuck in the "wannabe" category for decades. You'll examine how your choice of riding sport may or may not be the best for who you are and where you live, and how those frustrating hurdles known as "life circumstances" don't necessarily hold you back like you think they do. Plus, find out how to build a strong support team by winning people to your cause and choosing the right teachers and mentors. Analyze your physical self (your body, how it is formed and how you care for it) and your intellectual self (your "horse smarts" and how you are adding to them or not) and apply the results to your "gonna-be-good" equation. Learn to take a good hard look at your partner&#x2014;your horse&#x2014;and think critically about his ability to help you attain your riding goals. In addition, discover the nine key character traits of successful riders and how you can learn to call each one of them your own. Along the way you'll read the stories of 23 of the world's top riders from different disciplines and sports&#x2014;including dressage, reining, driving, show jumping, endurance, hunter/jumper, and eventing&#x2014;and how they "got good" despite the same kinds of challenges and setbacks you face in your own day-to-day riding. You'll get an inside look at their path to success, as well as their very best tips for how to "make it" in the horse industry.</p><p>Denny Emerson is an eventer, a trainer, a coach, and an activist who has achieved the United States Eventing Association&#39;s Wofford Cup for lifetime service to eventing.

As soon as she met a man who loved sailing like she did, she married him. When her husband was given command of a clipper ship custom-made to travel quickly, she knew that they would need every bit of its speed for their maiden voyage: out of New York City, down around the tip of Cape Horn, and into San Francisco, where the Gold Rush was well under way. In a time when few women even accompanied their husbands onboard, Ellen Prentiss navigated their ship to set the world record for speed along that route.</p><p><b>A Margaret Ferguson Book</b></p></p><p><p><b>Tracey Fern</b> is the author of three other picture books, <i>Barnum</i>'<i>s Bones, Buffalo Music</i>, and <i>Pippo the Fool</i>, all Junior Library Guild selections. She lives with her family in West Newton, Massachusetts. </p><p><b>Emily Arnold McCully</b> has written and illustrated many children's books, including the Caldecott Medal Book <i>Mirette on the High Wire</i>. She divides her time between New York City and her country home.</p>Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;In the summer of 1851, the clipper Flying Cloud made the journey from New York City to San Francisco in a record-breaking 89 days and 21 hours despite several setbacks and dangers along the way. Much of the credit for that voyage goes to Ellen Prentiss Creesy, the ship's navigator. Based on the true story of that voyage, this book expertly describes Prentiss's early life, her love for the sea and the science of navigation, her marriage to Captain Perkins Creesy, and their remarkable accomplishment. Readers will find this fictionalized account gripping and inspiring. McCully's excellent watercolor illustrations include a number of period details and add a sense of movement and drama to the already exciting text. An author's note gives the factual background for the story, and a brief glossary serves to familiarize readers with nautical terms. This is a well-executed narrative on a topic that has not received much coverage since Armstrong Sperry's 1936 Newbery Honor book, All Sail Set: A Romance of the Flying Cloud (Winston, 1935).&#x2014;Misti Tidman, Licking County Library, Newark, OH</p><h2>The Prints of Andy Warhol</h2><p>An essay on Warhol&#39;s work with silkscreen printing accompanies a selection of his prints from the sixties, seventies, and eighties</p><p></p><h2>Tom Clancy&#39;s EndWar</h2><p><b>A new phenomenon begins.</b> <br><br> <b>Created by #1 New York Times bestselling author Tom Clancy</b> <br><br> Based on the bestselling video game, this new series will take readers onto the battlefields of World War III with the technical savvy and explosive action that Clancy fans have come to expect.</p><p>Thirty years ago&nbsp;<b>Tom Clancy</b>&nbsp;was a Maryland insurance broker with a passion for naval history.

For example, we learn the damp origins of the good doctor&#x2019;s sidekick, Moist; we gain some insight into Penny&#x2019;s charitable nature; and we get to see a glimpse of what made Billy into the formidable evil Doctor he is today. Not to worry; there are appearances of the heroically chiseled Captain Hero and the Evil League of Evil and its diabolical leader, Bad Horse. We even get to see some new faces like the Captain&#x2019;s teammates on the Council of Champions, the wannabe hero Johnny Snow, and the dastardly Fake Thomas Jefferson. Whedon (Joss&#x2019; brother) hits all of the right notes, with punchy writing that is loaded with humor and well-placed snark, and finely tuned characterizations. Likewise, all of the artists turn in stellar work that flows nicely through the transitions. Fans of the original Sing-Along Blog and other die-hard Whedon-ites will, of course, feel compelled to read this book; but it&#x2019;s a winner that will appeal even beyond this crowd. Provided you can pry it out of their hands.

Her writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>Boston Review</i>, <i>New York Magazine</i>, and <i>BOMB</i>. She lives in Brooklyn.Eisenstadt's fast-paced first novel chronicles the coming-of-age of four working-class Irish youths growing up in Far Rockaway during the early 1980s. The spirit of the time and place is well captured, and the numerous beach scenes (three of the main characters work as summer lifeguards) are extremely evocative. The characters lead emotionally eventful lives: Alex struggles to escape "Rotaway" on a college scholarship; Timmy searches for the father who abandoned him when he was an infant; Chowderhead temporarily adopts a precocious nine-year-old boy. Still, the reader waits for some major, unifying development. Suddenly emerging as accomplished in her craft, Eisenstadt closes with three excellent chapters, tying in the random elements and providing an unexpected yet satisfying finish.

Award-winning biographer Suzanne Finstad perceptively pieces together the clues from candid interviews with all the Presley intimates&#x2014;including Priscilla herself, along with hundreds of sources who have never before spoken publicly&#x2014;to uncover the surprising truths behind the legend of Elvis and Priscilla, a tumultuous tale of sexual attraction and obsession, heartbreak and loss. <br><br><i>Child Bride</i>, the only major biography of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley, unveils the controversial child-woman who evolved from a lonely and sexually precocious teenager kept by the King of Rock and Roll into a shrewd businesswoman in control of the multimillion-dollar Elvis Presley empire, a rags-to-riches saga of secrets and betrayals that began when Priscilla was only three years old.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>With three steamy books by the women in Elvis's life already published (1997's <i>Elvis: In the Twilight of Memory</i> by June Juanico; Priscilla Beaulieu Presley's 1991 tell-all, <i>Elvis and Me</i>; and Joyce Bova's <i>Don't Ask Forever: My Love Affair with Elvis</i>), can the world absorb another? Suzanne Finstad, author of <i>Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley</i>, certainly hopes so. <p> With as many darkly intriguing details as the chambers of Graceland, Finstad--journalist, lawyer, and author of two true-crime books--defends her own theories on the complexity and grit of the former Mrs. Presley.

Drawing on new archival materials, acclaimed historian Ramachandra Guha follows Gandhi&#x2019;s struggle to deliver India from British rule, to forge harmonious relations between India&#x2019;s Hindus and Muslims, to end the pernicious practice of untouchability, and to nurture India&#x2019;s economic and moral self-reliance. He shows how in each of these campaigns, Gandhi adapted methods of nonviolence that successfully challenged British authority and would influence revolutionary movements throughout the world. A revelatory look at the complexity of Gandhi&#x2019;s thinking and motives, the book is a luminous portrait of not only the man himself, but also those closest to him&#x2014;family, friends, and political and social leaders.</p><p>Ramachandra Guha has taught at Stanford University, the University of Oslo, the Indian Institute of Science, and the London School of Economics.

He lives in Bangalore.&nbsp;www ramachandraguha.in<p><b>Chapter One </b><br><br> The Returning Hero<br><br> I.<br><br>On 18 July 1914, Mohandas Gandhi sailed from Cape Town for London. With him were his wife, Kasturba, and his closest friend, a Jewish architect named Hermann Kallenbach. Gandhi was leaving South Africa for good, after two decades spent there in various roles: lawyer, editor, food faddist, activist and prisoner. He had been the unquestioned leader of the small Indian community in South Africa. Now he wished to work with, and for, the several hundred million people of his homeland.<br><br> One of the Gandhis&#x2019; four children was already in India; the others were on their way, part of a larger group of students from Phoenix, the settlement that Gandhi had established in rural Natal. The patriarch wished to go to London first, because his mentor, the great Poona* educationist and politician Gopal Krishna Gokhale, was there. Ever since they first met in 1896, Gokhale had been the Indian whom Gandhi most admired. In his years in the diaspora he wrote to him regularly, consulting him on matters of politics and social reform. Gokhale, in turn, visited Gandhi in South Africa in 1912, and raised money from wealthy Indians for the causes that Gandhi was fighting for.<br><br> Gandhi had first gone to South Africa in May 1893, as a legal adviser to a Gujarati merchant fighting a court case. After the dispute was resolved, he stayed on to build a successful law practice. Over time, he moved from lawyering to activism, leading campaigns in Natal and the Transvaal against racial laws that bore down heavily on Indians. He went to jail several times; his wife Kasturba too courted arrest. In between campaigns he read and thought deeply on religious matters, practised and advocated the simple life, and ran a weekly newspaper, <i>Indian Opinion </i>(much of which he wrote himself). <br><br> Gandhi&#x2019;s desire to consult Gokhale was born as much out of respect (for the older man) as ignorance (about his own country). At this stage he probably knew South Africa better than he knew India. He was intimately familiar with the peninsula of Kathiawar, where he was born and raised. He had lived briefly in Bombay, and visited Madras, Calcutta and Banaras. But vast areas of the subcontinent were unknown to him. Peasants constituted the majority of Indians; Gandhi had no knowledge of how they lived and laboured. <br><br> Gokhale was a leader of the Moderate wing of the Congress party. He believed in debate and dialogue, and in appealing to reason and justice. By these methods he hoped to persuade the colonial government to grant self-rule to his people. At the other end of the spectrum was a group of young Indian revolutionaries, some of whom Gandhi had met (and argued with) in London in 1909. These radicals believed that armed struggle was the only way to win freedom for India.<br><br> In South Africa, Gandhi had evolved a method of protest distinct and different both from the polite pleading of the Moderates and the bomb-throwing of the revolutionaries. He called this satyagraha, or truth-force. This involved the deliberate violation of laws deemed to be unjust. Protesting individually or in batches, satyagrahis courted arrest, and courted it again, until the offending law was repealed. In 1909, Gandhi asked the Congress to apply his method to India too. Satyagraha, he said, &#x2018;is the only weapon suited to the genius of our people and our land&#x2019;. For &#x2018;the many ills we suffer from in India it is an infallible panacea&#x2019;.<br><br> There were other ideas about India that Gandhi developed in South Africa. Himself a Hindu, he worked closely with Muslims. Himself a native Gujarati speaker, in South Africa he came into contact with Indians speaking Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali. He saw that the sustenance of religious and linguistic pluralism was central to the nurturing of nationhood. Living in London and Johannesburg, he became disenchanted with industrialism; he hoped that India would base its economic future on its peasant and craft traditions rather than mindlessly emulate the West.<br><br> Though largely unfamiliar with life in India, Gandhi had a reasonably clear idea of what he could contribute to his country. What he was not clear about was where he would base himself, what organizational affiliation he would seek, and what activities he would undertake. That is why he thought it prudent to first visit Gokhale in London. He needed to consult his guru and seek his guidance before embarking on a career in a land where he was, in political and social terms, an outsider.<br> &nbsp;<br> II.<br><br> Gandhi had first gone to England in 1888, to qualify as a lawyer. He went again in 1906 and 1909, representing to the Imperial Government the case for humane treatment of Indians in South Africa. This was his fourth visit, but the first time he was travelling in third class. On board, the Gandhis and Kallenbach lived mostly on fruits, nuts and milk. Every day, Gandhi spent an hour reading the Gita or the Ramayana to his wife, and another hour teaching Gujarati to his companion.<br><br> Gandhi and Kallenbach had first met in Johannesburg in 1904. The lawyer and the architect shared a common hero in Leo Tolstoy, under whose influence they abandoned their professions in favour of social work. Kallenbach was devoted to Gandhi, so devoted that the Indians in South Africa called him &#x2018;Hanuman&#x2019; (after the monkey god who had served Lord Rama). When the Gandhis decided to return to India, he said he would also come with them.<br><br> The simplicity that Tolstoy prescribed was harder for Kallenbach than for Gandhi. In Johannesburg he had liked going to the best barbers. He owned one of the first automobiles in the city. Gandhi was able to wean him off these luxuries, but the enchantment with modern technology remained. Now, on board the <i>S.S. Kinfaus</i>, the two argued about a pair of expensive binoculars that the architect owned&#x2014;and cherished. Kallenbach (out of a mixture of genuine respect and blind reverence) gave way, and the field glasses were flung into the sea.<br><br> These private arguments were soon overshadowed by the onset of war in Europe. On 28 June&#x2014;when the Gandhis were still in South Africa&#x2014;Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb. The <i>S.S. Kinfaus </i>sailed on 18 July towards a Europe still at peace. Ten days into the journey, Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia started mobilizing in defence of the Serbs, prompting the Germans to do the same on behalf of the Austrians. On 1 August, Germany and Russia were officially at war. Two days later, Germany invaded Belgium. Now France also stood threatened; on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Underwater mines had been laid in the English Channel; negotiating them carefully, the ship Gandhi was on docked in Southampton on 6 August.<br> &nbsp;<br> III.<br><br> When Gandhi arrived in London, Gokhale himself was stranded in France. He had gone to Vichy to rest; with the war, ships had temporarily been suspended between Paris and London. So Gokhale asked a friend, the poet Sarojini Naidu&#x2014;then holidaying in London&#x2014; to welcome the visitors on his behalf. <br><br> The Gandhis were staying with a Gujarati friend in Bayswater. It was raining when Mrs Naidu called on them, climbing (as she later wrote) &#x2018;the staircase of an ordinary London dwelling home to find myself confronted with a true Hindu idyll of radiant and domestic simplicity&#x2019;. Gandhi, the &#x2018;great South African leader&#x2019;, was &#x2018;reclining, a little ill and weary, on the floor eating his frugal meals of nuts and fruits (which I shared) and his wife was busy and content as though she were a mere modest housewife absorbed in a hundred details of household service, and not the world-famed heroine of a hundred noble sufferings in a nation&#x2019;s cause&#x2019;. <br><br> From their first meeting, Mrs Naidu got the sense that &#x2018;Mrs. Gandhi was like a bird with eager outstretched wings longing to annihilate the time and distance that lay before her and her far-off India, and impatient of the brief and necessary interruption in her homeward flight. The woman&#x2019;s heart within her was full of yearning for the accustomed sounds and scenes of her own land and the mother&#x2019;s heart within her full of passionate hunger for the beloved faces of her children.&#x2019;<br><br> Kasturba&#x2019;s yearning could not yet be realized, for her husband had decided that he must stay on in England to help with the War effort. In 1914, Gandhi was still an Empire loyalist. He believed that the racial laws in South Africa were an aberration, a departure from the equality of all subjects that Queen Victoria had promised. In his struggles against discrimination he had sometimes found support among English officials and politicians. Now that Britain was at war, the Empire&#x2019;s subjects must&#x2014;regardless of their race&#x2014;rally round to defend it.<br><br> In 1899, Gandhi had raised an ambulance corps during the Anglo-Boer war, and done so again in 1906, when the Natal government suppressed a Zulu rebellion. On both occasions, Gandhi had taken the side of the ruler, without bearing arms himself. Now, for the third time in fifteen years, he would lead his fellow Indians in nursing the wounded.<br> &nbsp;<br> IV.<br><br> Ten days after landing in London, Gandhi and Kasturba were guests of honour at a reception in Hotel Cecil. Sarojini Naidu was present, as were the nationalist politicians Lala Lajpat Rai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gandhi gave a speech, mostly on the South African satyagraha of 1913&#x2013;14, in which his wife and he, as well as several thousand others, had gone to jail. Praising the courage and sacrifice of the Tamil satyagrahis in Natal, he said: &#x2018;These men and women are the salt of India; on them will be built the Indian nation that is to be.&#x2019;<br><br> The long sea journey had exhausted Gandhi. He was suffering from pain in his legs. A doctor he saw suspected pleurisy. But he carried on with his work; by the end of August, close to a hundred Indians had signed up for a training class in nursing.<br><br> Gandhi&#x2019;s decision to help in the war effort attracted criticism. Henry Polak, a radical Jew who had been his political lieutenant in South Africa, told him it was a departure from his professions of ahimsa, or non-violence. So did Gandhi&#x2019;s nephew Maganlal. The novelist Olive Schreiner&#x2014;a white South African passionately opposed to racism and imperialism&#x2014;wrote to Gandhi an anguished letter of protest. War, she said, &#x2018;was against my religion&#x2014;whether it is Englishmen travelling thousands of miles to kill Indians in India, or Indians travelling thousands of miles to kill white men whom they have never seen in Europe&#x2019;. She was &#x2018;struck to the heart with sorrow&#x2019; to read that Gandhi and the &#x2018;beautiful and beloved Indian poetess&#x2019; (Sarojini Naidu) had offered to serve the British Government &#x2018;<i>in any way </i>they might demand of you&#x2019;. She continued: &#x2018;Surely you, who would not take up arms even in the cause of your own oppressed people cannot be willing to shed blood in this wicked cause.&#x2019;<br><br> Gandhi&#x2019;s reply to Olive Schreiner is unrecorded. To his nephew Maganlal, he said that since London owed its food and supplies to the protection of the navy, merely by living there he was participating in the conflict. Attending to the war wounded was his way of repayment for this protection. Otherwise, he wrote, &#x2018;there was only one right course left, which was to go away to live in some mountain or cave in England itself and subsist on whatever food or shelter Nature might provide . . . I do not yet possess the spiritual strength necessary for this.&#x2019;<br><br> When another Gujarati friend complained that Gandhi&#x2019;s war work was an abdication of ahimsa, he answered that he was not shooting, merely nursing. He hoped to get a chance to attend to wounded Germans so that he &#x2018;could nurse them without any partisan spirit&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> V. <br><br> Gokhale had now returned to London and had long conversations with Gandhi. Each was anxious about the other person&#x2019;s health. Gandhi worried that his mentor was overweight and did not exercise enough. Gokhale, on his part, thought Gandhi&#x2019;s pleurisy a consequence of his fruit-and-nut diet. <br><br> Gokhale was keen that Gandhi join his Servants of India Society, which focused on education and social reform. Perhaps he could start a chapter of the society in his home province of Gujarat. However, he advised Gandhi to refrain from public work for a year after his return. He should use this period of &#x2018;probation&#x2019; to travel around a country he scarcely knew.<br><br> Gokhale sailed for Bombay on 24 October 1914. The Gandhis would have followed him immediately, except that the British government had refused to grant permission to Kallenbach to accompany them to India, for he was technically a German citizen, and now an &#x2018;enemy alien&#x2019;. Gandhi made several representations, saying that since he had lived for many years in South Africa, Kallenbach considered himself a naturalized Briton. Influential Englishmen whom Gandhi knew were asked to plead on behalf of Kallenbach. The Colonial Office was unmoved; Gandhi&#x2019;s &#x2018;German&#x2019; friend could not go to India; he was shipped off to an internment camp on the Isle of Man instead. The Gandhis had to return home without Kallenbach.<br><br> What would Gandhi do on his return to India after two decades in exile? An interesting prediction was offered by C.F. Andrews, an English priest and friend of Gokhale&#x2019;s who had taught for many years at St Stephen&#x2019;s College in Delhi. In January 1914, Andrews had worked closely with Gandhi in mediating a settlement with the South African authorities, which abolished a poll tax levied on Indians and also lifted some other restrictions on them. In December of that year, Andrews wrote to Gokhale that<br><br> &#x201c;I have been thinking a great deal about what Mr. Gandhi will do on his return. Perhaps it is no use thinking as he is bound to take his own course, whatever it may be. <i>He is not one who can be bound</i>. I do feel positive about one thing, that he could not for long [fit] in with the <i>general </i>work of the Servants of India [Society]. He might take up some special sphere, such as work among the depressed classes [i.e. the &#x2018;untouchables&#x2019;], but <i>he would need to be quite independent</i>.&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Promise Bible: All of God&#39;s promises highlighted for you</h2><p>Scripture is not only a record of God's promises, but also a record of the way he has always fulfilled his promises to his people.

Sections such as "From Forestland to Farmland to Funland" describe reciprocal influences of ecosystems, humans, and topography over time. Sections on specific bioregions explain unique interactions of climate and the living world. Whether writing about the emergence of mountain ranges millennia ago, building interstate highways, encounters of indigenous cultures with Europeans, or Act 250's environmental impact, they make it clear that this is not a typical nature guide. <br><br>They describe the pre-human evolution of the area and its development into distinct biophysical regions, and then show how pre-Columbian inhabitants engaged and altered the landscape. They trace both the enormous effects of European settlement, as well as how the ecosystem influenced human habitation and activity. Finally, they examine Vermont's three natural communities: forest, open terrestrial, and aquatic. Throughout, they impart much specific knowledge about Vermont, speculate on its future, and foster an appreciation of the complex synergy of forces that produced this region.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 19 illus. 3 figs. 9 tables. 17 maps.

With contributions from a number of doctors, nurses, and educators, the message is encouraging: "you can enjoy an active and healthy life... if you do your part." Chapter one presents disease facts, spelling out the differences between type I (largely heredity) and type II (the fast-rising kind, related to lifestyle issues like obesity). Subsequent chapters explain blood glucose levels, how to monitor them and how to control them with medication and diet. The book iterates often that, "contrary to popular myth," there "is no diabetes diet," but rather a simple strategy of moderation, variety and regular meal times (which epicureans in mourning should appreciate, along with easy, imaginative recipes like Baked Chicken with Pears). The next chapters deal with food, exercise, self-motivation, and specific medical issues like insulin pumps and prescription treatments. Much information on prevention gives this volume a wider appeal; any household with a diabetes patient (or a family history) should find use for this thorough, friendly, fully-illustrated overview. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Victor Ambrus, who has been the Channel 4 <i>Time Team</i> artist since the program's inception in 1994, has selected some of the key excavations from the many series, especially those of the last three years, to show how it has been possible to recreate snapshots of the past. The book forms a collection of reconstruction drawings, which convert the bare bones of archaeological excavation into living history: through the eyes of the artist, we see people from the past going about their daily lives. What comes to light reflects not just drawing but the experiences of an illustrator for whom tramping through mud and wandering around in horizontal rain are all part of the fun. Ambrus' evocative sketches cover everyday life in the country and the towns; trade and industry; religion, crime and punishment.

Shows that prefabricated can be mainstream traditional design and does not have to look like a mobile home or a modular "Dwell" box.<br>Prefabulous describes the many systems available for prefabricating all or parts of a new home, including timber frame and log, as well as modular, panelized, structural insulated panels, steel framing and concrete systems, which are relatively new. Prefabulous describes these systems, compares their advantages and disadvantages, and shows beautiful examples of houses built using these techniques. Although all of these "prefabricated" houses look very different, all of them were manufactured partially or almost completely in a controlled factory environment and transported to the home site to be erected. As a group these systems offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and sometimes more cost-efficient method of building.<br>Includes a foreword by Not So Big House author Sarah Susanka, who writes: "For homeowners who want to know the options, the advantages and disadvantages of those options, and to see how those prefabricated parts come together into a good, attractive home, read this book."</p><p><p>Sheri Koones isa bestselling author and expert on small houses, energy efficiency, and prefabrication whose previous books include <em>Prefabulous</em>, <em>Prefabulous Small Houses</em>, <em>Prefabulous + Sustainable,</em> <em>Prefabulous + Almost Off the Grid</em>, and <em>Prefabulous World</em>. She won the prestigious Robert Bruss Real Estate Book Award from NAREE in 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2017. Koones is also a columnist and speaker. </p>Normally, I am turned off by real estate books with clever, cute titles such as "Prefabulous" by Sheri Koones. However, I am "turned on" by this great, new, beautiful book that completely changed my mind about so-called "prefab" homes, which are custom built in factories to the specifications of the buyers. As with all Taunton Press "coffee-table-quality" books with lots of color photos, the only word to describe this one is "amazing." It includes all prefab systems that are used to engineer and assemble homes in factories, then ship them on trucks to the home site. Panelized, log, timber-frame, concrete, hybrids and steel-frame homes are included. As famous author and home designer Sarah Susanka says in her forward to the book, "For some people, words like modular, manufactured, panelized and prefabricated conjure up visions of ticky-tacky subdivisions in which every house looks just the same. But the biggest story in 'Prefabuous' is that just because something is made in a factory doesn't mean it has to be boring or the same as hundreds of other houses." This ultracomplete book not only shows the many varieties of prefab homes now available, but the author has done an admirable job of educating readers about what they need to know. If you are considering building your home on a lot you already own or want to acquire, this book will open your eyes to show what can be done with prefab homes, which look like custom homes but cost a lot less. The many examples and explanations show what can be accomplished. On my scale of one to 10, this superb book rates an off-the-chart 12.<br>--Robert J. Bruss, Inman News<br>Americans build about 40,000 modular homes a year. Imagine if new-home buyersand builders realized all the advantages of building a home in a factory setting. No exposure to the elements. No loss of materials. No work days lost to bad weather. The ability for more precise measurements. In "Prefabulous: The House of Your Dreams Delivered Fresh From the Factory" (Taunton Press, $25), Sheri Koones gives readers an up-close-and-personal look at the modular industry. Unlike site-built homes, modular homes often are built stronger, with tighter insulation and more efficient use of materials. Koones' book examines modular structures from Long Island, N.Y., to San Francisco and building techniques that range from sticks to concrete. If you're considering a new home, this book is a must-buy. "- Newsday"<br>[Koones] clearly explains eight types of prefab components and how they can be used to create custom log homes, traditional bungalows, timber-frame barns and concrete- or steel-frame contemporaries. All are welcome improvements over their often-ugly predecessors. Prefab construction saves time, money and materials because everything is made to precise specs indoors. Bad weather is simply not a delaying factor. Once the foundation is set, the rest of the house -- walls, floors, dormers and roofing -- can go up in a matter of weeks or months. How prefabulous. --Annie Groer, "The Washington Post"<br>It's clear from the title that Sheri Koones' new book isn't going to tell us that there's something wrong with the resurrection of prefabricated home building. Prefabulous glorifies the technique by showing beautiful homes that even an expert would not guess had been built, in pieces or in whole, in factories. That's OK -- as Koones tells it, this can be a cheaper andgreener way to build than stick by stick. She does explain the various systems of prefab -- including modular, panelized, SIPs, concrete, steel and log -- and gives pluses and minuses for each. --Susan Fornoff, "San Francisco Chronicle<br>""Prefabulous, the House of Your Dreams Delivered Fresh from the Factory" (Taunton Press, $25) will shatter your misconceptions about small, boxy and modern structures. These prefabs are customized and so rich in detail and style they are hardly distinguishable from "traditionally" built homes. Sheri Koones brings together the prefab building systems - new and old - describing and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each. It's hard to believe after seeing the photos, but each featured home was manufactured partially or completely in a controlled factory environment then moved to the site. "--The Cincinnati Enquirer "<br>"<br>"<br>Sheri Koones demystifies the concept of the prefabricated house, and explains why these factory-built homes are greener, more efficient, sturdier and more cost-effective than site-built homes. The book examines all types of prefab houses, including modular, panelized, timber frame, concrete and steel, as well as log construction and homes built with structural insulated panels (SIPs). "--Smart Homeowner"<br>In her foreword to Sheri Koones' new book, architect Sarah Susanka makes an intriguing point: We'd never agree to have a new car assembled in the driveway or a new dishwasher put together on the kitchen floor. Yet when it comes to houses, many of us assume one built on site is superior to one constructed in a factory. "Prefabulous" offers evidence to the contrary. Factory construction, Koones' book argues, savestime, money and building materials, and can result in sturdy houses that require less energy and maintenance. Yet as her book illustrates, it doesn't require sacrifices regarding the home's design. --"Akron Beacon Journal"</p><h2>Solo: A James Bond Novel</h2><p><p>It's 1969, and, having just celebrated his forty-fifth birthday, James Bond&#x2014;British special agent 007&#x2014;is summoned to headquarters to receive an unusual assignment.

Not only did they lose their leader turned serial killer, Agent Locke, their involvement provoked the attention of FBI authorities and they are now faced with the stoic, by-the-books replacement, Agent Sterling. Suddenly the Naturals are struggling with curfews and study sessions and are confined once again to cold cases. However, they are quickly involved in an ongoing investigation connected to Dean, the pensive and restrained profiler whose father is currently serving prison time for murder. In the course of the investigation, the Naturals are able to use their skills to find answers to aide the FBI. These answers come at a price; Dean must face his father, Cassie winds up confined to the house, and the other team members take considerable risks to acquire interviews and information. Readers will want to be familiar with the first book since the characters' skills and previous relationships are assumed information. The engaging plot moves at an even pace, though a bit slower than its predecessor, and the murder mystery is compelling. The love triangle among Cassie, Michael, and Dean continues and development of all the characters is furthered with revelations of their past.

Nagel brings the formidable Marie-Thï¿½rï¿½se to life, along with the age of revolution and the waning days of the aristocracy, in a page-turning biography that will appeal to fans of Antonia Fraser's <i>Marie Antoinette</i> and Amanda Foreman's <i>Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire</i>. </p><p>In December 1795, at midnight on her seventeenth birthday, Marie-Thï¿½rï¿½se, the only surviving child of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, escaped from Paris's notorious Temple Prison. To this day many believe that the real Marie-Thï¿½rï¿½se, traumatized following her family's brutal execution during the Reign of Terror, switched identities with an illegitimate half sister who was often mistaken for her twin. Was the real Marie-Thï¿½rï¿½se spirited away to a remote castle to live her life as the woman called "the Dark Countess," while an imposter played her role on the political stage of Europe? Now, two hundred years later, using handwriting samples, DNA testing, and an undiscovered cache of Bourbon family letters, Nagel finally solves this mystery. She tells the remarkable story in full and draws a vivid portrait of an astonishing woman who both defined and shaped an era. Marie-Thï¿½rï¿½se's deliberate choice of husbands determined the map of nineteenth-century Europe. Even Napoleon was in awe and called her "the only man in the family." Nagel's gripping narrative captures the events of her fascinating life from her very public birth in front of the rowdy crowds and her precocious childhood to her hideous time in prison and her later reincarnation in the public eye as a saint, and, above all, her fierce loyalty to France throughout.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Nagel </b>is the bestselling author of Mistress of the Elgin Marbles and a critically acclaimed book on the novels of Jean Giraudoux. She has written for the stage, screen, scholarly journals, and Town and Country. She is a professor in the humanities department at Marymount Manhattan College and lives in New York City.</p>Rosalyn Landor is a sympathetic narrator who mirrors Nagel's admiration of Marie Therese, daughter of Marie Antoinette. The book recounts the initial journey of Marie Antoinette to the French court and explores the political underpinnings and ramifications of the French Revolution, including the deaths of the king and queen and the imprisonment of their daughter and her younger brother, the dauphin. The story follows Marie Therese to her death in exile many years later. Landor's firm, well-paced narration is delivered in a serious tone. She projects a trace of indignation at the descriptions of the abominable treatment of Marie Therese and her brother in prison. The French language quotations, as well as people and place names, are dealt with smoothly and fluently.

By the author of Above Top Secret. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Not only do the aliens walk among us but, until recently, they were working tentacle-in-hand with the US military--or so British ufologist Good (Above Top Secret, 1988) implies in this erratically organized, incredible report. While Good's earlier book made a well-documented case for clandestine federal involvement in UFO research, this more anectodal study will convert few to the cause. Despite the tantalizing subtitle, much of what Good presents is familiar fare, beginning with his selection of reported run-ins between aircraft and UFOs. He focuses next on the provocative (and well-covered elsewhere) controversy about alleged UFO culpability in cattle mutilations. A close-up look at strange doings at a Colorado ranch plagued by mutilations sheds more mystery than light (``At about two a.m...a mechanical-sounding voice was heard coming from all the radio and TV speakers....`Attention. We have allowed you to remain. We have interfered with your lives very little. Do not cause us to take action which you will regret' ''), while Good's rapid-fire rundown of assorted purported human-alien contacts rehashes old cases like the Roswell incident (alien bodies recovered in 1947 in New Mexico). A gnarly discussion of intelligence community disinformation about UFOs follows, leading to Good's core case: the testimony of physicist Bob Lazar, who claims to have worked at an Air Force test site in Nevada where he tinkered with extraterrestrial craft and learned that aliens had been in ``liaison'' with the military until a 1979 ``incident'' resulted in the death of 66 humans and the flight of the ETs, who left their craft behind. Good does admit that Lazar's credibility has been shaken by a recent conviction for pimping. True believers will be interested to learn that Jesus may have been a ``genetically engineered'' alien; others will want to pass in favor of the more grounded work of Jacques Vallee (Revelations, 1991, etc.).

For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town&#x2019;s founder, it is a haven in another sense&#x2013;as the first place in his life he&#x2019;s had a loving family to call his own.<br><br>And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities.<br><br>When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired&#x2013;and apparently ill&#x2013;soldier presents himself at the town&#x2019;s doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value&#x2013;love, patriotism, community, family, friendship&#x2013;not to mention the town&#x2019;s very survival, is imperiled.<br><br>Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, <i>The Last Town on Earth</i> is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.</p><p>Wow. This stunning book succeeds on so many different levels--as an engrossing story, a character study, a history lesson, a modern day political allegory--I don't even know where to begin the praise. <i>The Last Town on Earth</i> centers on the inhabitants of a small logging town in Washington and what happens when they take drastic measures (quarantine) to try and protect themselves from the virulent and deadly flu epidemic of 1918. When a deserting WWI soldier demands sanctuary, events are set in motion that change the town forever.<p> Although this is Mullen's first published work, there are none of the usual verbal pyrotechnics or high-wire "look how well I can write" balancing acts one sees with beginning authors. How refreshing to read a younger author who has already progressed beyond his ego and knows that it's all about story, story, story. Mullen tells his tale cleanly, simply and plainly--making the ironies and allegories all the more potent. I knew almost nothing of the flu epidemic of 1918 and even less about the political climate in the US during WW1. These are not subjects I would go out of my way to read about, but Mullen has made them compelling and interesting. In fact, the author's voice has the same level of confidence and maturity that one only finds in writers with decades more experience (I kept thinking of Wallace Stegner and Alice Munro while I was reading)--authors who earn your trust and confidence so early and easily that you completely relax into the writing and the voice. It's already on my Ten Best List; I can't imagine I'll read ten better books this year.

Universally recognized as the definitive work on the Kabbalah, and much more. The Zohar is a wellspring of spiritual energy, a fountainhead of metaphysical power that not only reveals and explains, but literally brings blessing, protection, and well-being into the lives of all those who read or peruse its sacred texts. Unlike other books, The Zohar is written in a kind of code, through which metaphors, parables, and cryptic language at first conceal but ultimately reveal the forces of creation. As electrical current is concealed in wire and cable before disclosing itself as an illuminated light bulb, the spiritual Light of the Creator is wrapped in allegory and symbolism throughout the Aramic text of the Zohar. It&#39;s primary purpose is not only to help us acquire wisdom, but to draw Light from the Upper Worlds and to bring sanctification into our lives.</p><p></p><h2>Exploring Proverbs: Proverbs 1:1-19:5 (The Exploring Series, Vol 1)</h2><p>This series has features that will make it a favorite of Bible students: * detailed alliterative outline * notes about the authorship * straightforward interpretation of the text * practical application.

Shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize. Richard Holmes, prize-winning biographer of Coleridge and Shelley, explores the scientific ferment that swept across Britain at the end of 18th century in this ground-breaking new biography . &#39;The Age of Wonder&#39; is Richard Holmes&#39;s first major work of biography in over a decade. It has been inspired by the scientific ferment that swept through Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, which Holmes now radically redefines as &#39;the revolution of Romantic Science&#39;. The book opens with Joseph Banks stepping onto a Tahitian beach in 1796, hoping to discover Paradise. The young botanist had set sail in search of new worlds - inspired by the Romantic revolution of science that was sweeping through Britain. Banks goes on to introduce us to William Herschel, whose groundbreaking dedication to the stars forever changed the public conception of the solar system, and Humphry Davy, whose creation of the Safety Lamp went on to save thousands of lives. These are just a few of the lives covered in this remarkable work in which Holmes charts the many voyages of discovery - astronomical, chemical, poetical, philosophical - that made up this `age of wonder&#39;. From telescopic sight to miner&#39;s lamp, and from the first balloon flight to African exploration, it tells the stories of great innovations, and the inspired individuals behind them.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Oliver Sacks on <i>The Age of Wonder</i></strong> <br> <p>Oliver Sacks is the author of <i>Musicophilia</i>, <i>Awakenings</i>,<i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>, and many other books, for which he has received numerous awards, including the Hawthornden Prize, a Polk Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and lives in New York City, where he is a practicing neurologist. Read his exclusive guest review of <i>The Age of Wonder</i>:</p> <p> I am a Richard Holmes addict. He is an incomparable biographer, but in <i>The Age of Wonder</i>, he rises to new heights and becomes the biographer not of a single figure, but of an entire unique period, when artist and scientist could share common aims and ambitions and a common language--and together create a "romantic," humanist science. We are once again on the brink of such an age, when science and art will come together in new and powerful ways. For this we could have no better model than the lives of William and Caroline Herschel and Humphry Davy, whose dedication and scientific inventiveness were combined with a deep sense of wonder and poetry in the universe. Only Holmes, who is so deeply versed in the people and culture of eighteenth-century science, could tell their story with such verve and resonance for our own time.</p> <p>(Photo ï¿½ Elena Seibert)</p>Richard Holmes is Professor of Biographical Studies at the University of East Anglia, and editor of the Harper Perennial series Classic Biographies launched in 2004.

It also includes common predicaments you might find yourself in, such as moving house, looking for Mr. or Mrs. Right, or having a midlife crisis. Life&#x2019;s bigger challenges, such as losing a loved one or becoming a single parent, are in here too. Whether you&#x2019;ve got the hiccups or a hangover, a fear of commitment or a sense of humor failure, we consider it an ailment that deserves a remedy.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s another difference too. Our medicines are not something you&#x2019;ll find at the drugstore, but at the bookshop, in the library, or downloaded onto your electronic reading device. We are bibliotherapists, and the tools of our trade are books. Our apothecary contains Balzacian balms and Tolstoyan tourniquets, the salves of Saramago and the purges of Perec and Proust. To create it, we have trawled two thousand years of literature for the most brilliant minds and restorative reads, from Apuleius, second-century author of <i>The Golden Ass</i>, to the contemporary tonics of Ali Smith and Jonathan Franzen.</p><p>Bibliotherapy has been popular in the form of the nonfiction self-help book for several decades now. But lovers of literature have been using novels as salves&#x2014;either consciously or subconsciously&#x2014;for centuries. Next time you&#x2019;re feeling in need of a pick-me-up or require assistance with an emotional tangle, reach for a novel. Our belief in the effectiveness of fiction as the purest and best form of bibliotherapy is based on our own experience with patients and bolstered by an avalanche of anecdotal evidence. Sometimes it&#x2019;s the story that charms; other times it&#x2019;s the rhythm of the prose that works on the psyche, stilling or stimulating. Sometimes it&#x2019;s an idea or an attitude suggested by a character in a similar quandary or jam. Either way, novels have the power to transport you to another existence and see the world from a different point of view. When you&#x2019;re engrossed in a novel, unable to tear yourself from the page, you are seeing what a character sees, touching what a character touches, learning what a character learns. You may <i>think</i> you&#x2019;re sitting on the sofa in your living room, but the important parts of you&#x2014;your thoughts, your senses, your spirit&#x2014;are somewhere else entirely. &#x201c;To read a writer is for me not merely to get an idea of what he says, but to go off with him and travel in his company,&#x201d; said Andrï¿½ Gide. No one comes back from such a journey quite the same.</p><p>Whatever your ailment, our prescriptions are simple: a novel (or two), to be read at regular intervals. Some treatments will lead to a complete cure. Others will simply offer solace, showing you that you are not alone. All will offer the temporary relief of your symptoms due to the power of literature to distract and transport. Sometimes the remedy is best taken as an audiobook, or read aloud with a friend. As with all medicines, the full course of treatment should always be taken for best results. Along with the cures, we offer advice on particular reading issues, such as being too busy to read or what to read when you can&#x2019;t sleep, along with the ten best books to read in each decade of life; and the best literary accompaniments for important rituals or rites of passage, such as being on vacation&#x2014;or on your deathbed.*</p><p>We wish you every delight in our fictional plasters and poultices. You will be healthier, happier, and wiser for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A</p><p>ABANDONMENT</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Plainsong</i></p><p>KENT HARUF</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If inflicted early, the effects of physical or emotional abandonment&#x2014;whether you were left by too busy parents to bring yourself up, told to take your tears and tantrums elsewhere, or off-loaded onto another set of parents completely (see: Adoption)&#x2014;can be hard to shrug. If you&#x2019;re not careful, you might spend the rest of your life expecting to be let down. As a first step to recovery, it is often helpful to realize that those who abandon you were most likely abandoned themselves. And rather than wishing they&#x2019;d buck up and give you the support or attention you yearn for, put your energy into finding someone else to lean on who&#x2019;s better equipped for the job.</p><p>Abandonment is rife in <i>Plainsong</i>, Kent Haruf&#x2019;s account of small-town life in Holt, Colorado. Local schoolteacher Guthrie has been abandoned by his depressed wife, Ella, who feigns sleep when he tries to talk to her and looks at the door with &#x201c;outsized eyes&#x201d; when he leaves. Their two young sons, Ike and Bobby, are left bewildered by her unexplained absence from their lives. Old Mrs. Stearns has been abandoned by her relatives, either through death or neglect. And Victoria, seventeen years old and four months&#x2019; pregnant, is abandoned first by her boyfriend and then by her mother, who, in a backhanded punishment to the man who&#x2019;d abandoned them both many years before, tells her, &#x201c;You got yourself into this, you can just get out of it,&#x201d; and kicks her out of the house.</p><p>Gradually, and seemingly organically&#x2014;although in fact it is mostly orchestrated by Maggie Jones, a young woman with a gift for communication&#x2014;other people step into the breach. Most astonishing are the McPheron brothers, a pair of &#x201c;crotchety and ignorant&#x201d; cattle-farming bachelors who agree to take the pregnant Victoria in: &#x201c;They looked at her, regarding her as if she might be dangerous. Then they peered into the palms of their thick callused hands spread out before them on the kitchen table and lastly they looked out the window toward the leafless and stunted elm trees.&#x201d; The next thing we know they are running around shopping for cribs, and the rush of love for the pair felt by Victoria, as well as the reader, transforms them overnight. As we watch the community quicken to its role as extended family&#x2014;frail Mrs. Stearns teaching Ike and Bobby to make cookies, the McPherons watching over Victoria with all the tender, clumsy tenacity they normally reserve for their cows&#x2014;we see how support can come from very surprising places.</p><p>If you have been abandoned, don&#x2019;t be afraid to reach out to the wider community around you&#x2014;however little you know its inhabitants as individuals. They&#x2019;ll thank you for it one day.</p><p>ACCUSED, BEING</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i></p><p>PETER CAREY</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#x2019;re accused of something and you know you&#x2019;re guilty, accept your punishment with good grace. If you&#x2019;re accused and you didn&#x2019;t do it, fight to clear your name. And if you&#x2019;re accused and you know you did it but you don&#x2019;t think what you did was wrong, what <i>then</i>?</p><p>Australia&#x2019;s Robin Hood, Ned Kelly&#x2014;as portrayed by Peter Carey in <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>&#x2014;commits his first crime at ten years old when he kills a neighbor&#x2019;s heifer so his family can eat. The next thing he knows, he&#x2019;s been apprenticed (by his own mother) to the bushranger, Harry Power. When Harry robs the Buckland Coach, Ned is the &#x201c;nameless person&#x201d; who blocked the road with a tree and held the horses so &#x201c;Harry could go about his trade.&#x201d; And thus Ned&#x2019;s fate is sealed: He&#x2019;s an outlaw forever. He makes something glorious of it.</p><p>In his telling of the story&#x2014;which he has written down in his own words for his baby daughter to read one day, knowing he won&#x2019;t be around to tell her himself&#x2014;Ned seduces us completely with his rough-hewn, punctuation-free prose that bounds and dives over the page. But what really warms us to this Robin Hood of a boy/man is his strong sense of right and wrong: Ned is guided at all times by a fierce loyalty and a set of principles that happen not to coincide with those of the law. When his ma needs gold, he brings her gold; when both his ma and his sister are deserted by their faithless men, he&#x2019;ll &#x201c;break the 6th Commandment&#x201d; for their sakes. And even though Harry and his own uncles use him &#x201c;poorly,&#x201d; he never betrays them. How can we not love this murdering bushranger with his big heart? It is the world that&#x2019;s corrupt, not him, and we cheer and whoop from the sidelines as pistols flash and his Enfield answers. And so the novel makes outlaws of its readers.</p><p>Ned Kelly is a valuable reminder that just because someone has fallen foul of society&#x2019;s laws, he&#x2019;s not necessarily bad. It&#x2019;s up to each one of us to decide for ourselves what is right and wrong in life. Draw up your personal constitution, then live by it. If you step out of line, be the first to give yourself a reprimand.

Lorrie Moore&#x2019;s <i>Who Will Run the Frog Hospital?</i> is full of the usual horrors. The narrator, Berie, is a late developer who hides her embarrassment by mocking her &#x201c;fried eggs&#x201d; and &#x201c;tin cans run over by a car,&#x201d; and she and her best friend, Sils, roll about laughing when they remember how Sils once tried to shave off her pimples with a razor. In fact, laughing is something they do a lot of together&#x2014;and they do it &#x201c;violently, convulsively,&#x201d; with no sound coming out. They also sing songs together&#x2014;anything from Christmas carols to TV theme tunes<i> </i>and Dionne Warwick. And we applaud that they do. Because if you don&#x2019;t sing loudly and badly with your friends when you&#x2019;re fourteen and fifteen, letting the music prepare your heart for &#x201c;something drenching and big&#x201d; to come, when do you get to do it?</p><p>A teenage boy who makes no friends at all yet lives with incredible intensity is Orvil Pym in Denton Welch&#x2019;s <i>In Youth Is Pleasure</i>. This beautifully observed novel, published in 1945, takes place over the course of one languid summer against the backdrop of an English country hotel, where Orvil, caught in a state of pubescent confusion, holidays with his father and brothers. Aloof and apart, he observes the flaws in those around him with a pitiless lens. He explores the countryside, guiltily tasting the communion wine in a deserted church, then falling off his bike and crying in despair for &#x201c;all the tortures and atrocities in the world.&#x201d; He borrows a boat and rows down a river, glimpsing two boys whose bodies &#x201c;glinted like silk&#x201d; in the evening light. New worlds beckon, just beyond his reach, as he hovers on the edge of revelation. And for a while, he considers pretending to be mad, to avoid the horrors awaiting him back at school. Gradually he realizes that he cannot leap the next ten years&#x2014;that he just has to survive this bewildering stage and behave in &#x201c;the ordinary way,&#x201d; smiling and protecting his brothers&#x2019; pecking order by hiding his wilder impulses.</p><p>Adolescence doesn&#x2019;t have to be hell. Remember that your peers are struggling to cross the chasm too. If you can, share the struggles together. Friends or no friends, be sure to do the silly, crazy things that only adolescents do. Then, when you&#x2019;re older, at least you&#x2019;ll be able to look back at these heady, high, hormonal times and laugh.</p><p><i>See also:</i> Bed, inability to get out of ï¿½ Internet addiction ï¿½ Irritability ï¿½ Rails, going off the ï¿½ Risks, taking too many ï¿½ Teens, being in your</p><p>ADOPTION</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Run</i></p><p>ANN PATCHETT</p><p>ï¿½ &nbsp; ï¿½ &nbsp; ï¿½</p><p><i>The Graveyard Book</i></p><p>NEIL GAIMAN</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Children&#x2019;s literature is strewn with adoptees. Mary Lennox in <i>The Secret Garden</i> is a spoiled adoptee who learns to love in her new cold climate; Mowgli in <i>The Jungle Book</i> is brought up by wolves; Tarzan in the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs is reared by apes. A romance seems to surround these lost and found&#x2014;and indeed who, as a child, hasn&#x2019;t had a run-in with their parents and fantasized that they too were a foundling? Adoptees find their way into adult literature too: there&#x2019;s James in Grant Gillespie&#x2019;s <i>The Cuckoo Boy</i>, a novel with some disturbing views on adoption but a riveting read nonetheless; Heathcliff in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, who upsets the delicate balance of his adoptive family; &#x201c;Wart&#x201d; in T. H. White&#x2019;s <i>The Once and Future King</i>, who is one of the rare success stories in this list&#x2014;an adoptee who turns out to be Arthur, King of Camelot.</p><p>In reality, adoption is less romantic and can be hard for all concerned&#x2014;for the natural parents who decide to give their child away; for the child who finds out in a nonideal way (see: Abandonment); for children who blame their adoptive parents for their confusion and who may seek out their natural parents, only to be disappointed; and for the adoptive parents who have to decide when to tell their children that they are &#x201c;special&#x201d; and not blood related. The whole matter is fraught with pitfalls, but also with love, and it can bring an end to childless grief (see: Children, not having). Anyone involved would do well to explore its complexity via those who have been there before.</p><p>One of the loveliest novels featuring adoptees is Ann Patchett&#x2019;s <i>Run</i>. Bernard Doyle, the white ex-mayor of Boston, has three sons: Sullivan, Teddy, and Tip. One is a white redhead, and two are black, athletic, and extremely tall. Bernard&#x2019;s fiery-haired wife, Bernadette, Sullivan&#x2019;s mother, is dead. Teddy and Tip&#x2019;s real mother is &#x201c;the spy who came in from the cold&#x201d;&#x2014;she has watched her sons grow up from a distance, aware of their successes and failures, their friendships and rivalries, and presiding o...</p></p><h2>Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America</h2><p><br><strong>* Winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction<br>* Nominated for a 2013 Edgar Award&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>* Book of the Year (Non-fiction, 2012)&nbsp;<em>The Boston Globe</em>,&nbsp;<em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br> In 1949, Florida's orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve.

I'd learned that whatever I said would be misquoted, so I simply kept quiet. Once, I made the mistake of telling the truth to a female reporter. She'd looked so young and so in need herself that for a moment I let my guard down. I said, "He needs me." That's all. Just those three words. </p><p> Who would have thought that a second of unguarded honesty could cause so much turmoil? The girl -- she had certainly not attained the maturity of womanhood -- parlayed my small sentence into international turmoil. </p><p> I was right in thinking she herself was needy. Oh, yes, very needy. She needed a story, so she fabricated one. Never mind that she had nothing on which to base her fable. </p><p> I must say that she was good at research. She couldn't have slept during the two weeks between my remark and the publication of her story. She consulted psychiatrists, self-help gurus, and clergy. She interviewed hordes of rampant feminists. Every famous woman who had ever hinted that she hated men was interviewed and quoted. </p><p> In the end Jimmie and I were portrayed as one sick couple. He was the domineering tyrant in public, but a whimpering child at home. And I was shown to be a cross between steel and an ever-flowing breast. </p><p> When the article came out and caused a sensation, I wanted to hide from the world. I wanted to retreat to the most remote of Jimmie's twelve houses and never leave. But Jimmie was afraid of nothing -- which was the true secret of his success -- and he met the questions, the derisive laughter, and worse, the pseudo-therapists who felt it was our "duty" to expose every private thought and feeling to the world, head-on. </p><p> Jimmie just put his arm around me, smiled into the cameras, and laughed in answer to all of their questions. Whatever they asked, he had a joke for a reply. </p><p> "Is it true, Mr. Manville, that your wife is the power behind the throne?" The reporter asking this was smiling at me in a nasty way. Jimmie was six foot two and built like the bull some people said he was, and I am five foot two and round. I've never looked like the power behind anyone. </p><p> "She makes all the decisions. I'm just her front man," Jimmie said, his smile showing his famous teeth. But those of us who knew him saw the coldness in his eyes. Jimmie didn't like any disparagement of what he considered his. "I couldn't have done it without her," he said in that teasing way of his. Few people knew him well enough to know whether or not he was joking. </p><p> Three weeks later, by chance, I saw the cameraman who'd been with the reporter that day. He was a favorite of mine because he didn't delight in sending his editor the pictures of me that showed off my double chin at its most unflattering angle. "What happened to your friend who was so interested in my marriage?" I asked, trying to sound friendly. "Fired," the photographer said. "I beg your pardon?" He was pushing new batteries into his camera and didn't look up. "Fired," he said again, then looked up, not at me, but at Jimmie. </p><p> Wisely, the photographer said no more. And just as wisely, I didn't ask any more questions. </p><p> Jimmie and I had an unwritten, unspoken law: I didn't interfere in whatever Jimmie was doing. </p><p> "Like a Mafia wife," my sister said to me about a year after Jimmie and I were married. </p><p> "Jimmie doesn't murder people," I replied in anger. </p><p> That night I told Jimmie of the exchange with my sister, and for a moment his eyes glittered in a way that, back then, I hadn't yet learned to be wary of. </p><p> A month later, my sister's husband received a fabulous job offer: double his salary; free housing; free cars. A full-time nanny for their daughter, three maids, and a country club membership were included. It was a job they couldn't refuse. It was in Morocco. </p><p> After Jimmie's plane crashed and left me a widow at thirty-two, all the media around the world wrote of only one thing: that Jimmie had willed me "nothing." None of his billions -- two or twenty of them, I never could remember how many -- none of it was left to me. </p><p> "Are we broke or rich today?" I'd often ask him, because his net worth fluctuated from day to day, depending on what Jimmie was trying at the moment. </p><p> "Today we're broke," he'd say, and he would laugh in the same way as when he'd tell me he'd made so many millions that day. </p><p> The money never mattered to Jimmie. No one understood that. To him, it was just a by-product of the game. "It's like all those peels you throw away after you've made jam," he'd say. "Only in this case the world values the peel and not the jam." "Poor world," I said, then Jimmie laughed hard and carried me upstairs, where he made sweet love to me. </p><p> It's my opinion that Jimmie knew he wasn't going to live to be an old man. "I've got to do what I can as fast as I can. You with me, Frecks?" he'd ask. </p><p> "Always," I'd answer, and I meant it. "Always." </p><p> But I didn't follow him to the grave. I was left behind, just as Jimmie said I would be. </p><p> "I'll take care of you, Frecks," he said more than once. When he talked of such things, he always called me by the name he'd given me the first time we met: Frecks for the freckles across my nose. </p><p> When he said, "I'll take care of you," I didn't give the words much thought. Jimmie had always "taken care" of me. Whatever I wanted, he gave me long before I knew I wanted it. Jimmie said, "I know you better than you know yourself." </p><p> And he did. But then, to be fair, I never had time to get to know much about myself. Following Jimmie all over the world didn't leave a person much time to sit and contemplate. </p><p> Jimmie knew me, and he did take care of me. Not in the way the world thought was right, but in the way he knew I <i>needed.</i> He didn't leave me a rich widow with half the world's bachelors clamoring to profess love for me. No, he left the money and all twelve of the expensive houses to the only two people in the world he truly hated: his older sister and brother. </p><p> To me, Jimmie left a run-down, overgrown farm in the backwoods of Virginia, a place I didn't even know he owned, and a note. It said: </p><p> <i>Find out the truth about what happened, will you, Frecks? Do it for me. And remember that I love you. Wherever you are, whatever you do, remember that I love you. </i></p><p><i> J.</i> </p><p> When I saw the farmhouse, I burst into tears. What had enabled me to survive the past six weeks was the image of that farmhouse. I'd imagined something charming, made of logs, with a stone chimney at one end. I'd imagined a deep porch with hand-hewn rocking chairs on it, and a lawn in front, with pink roses spilling petals in the breeze. </p><p> I'd envisioned acres of gently rolling land covered with fruit trees and raspberry bushes -- all of them pruned and healthy and dripping ripe fruit. </p><p> But what I saw was 1960s hideous. It was a two-story house covered in some sort of green siding -- the kind that never changes over the years. Storms, sun, snow, time, none of it had any effect on that kind of siding. It had been a pale, sickly green when it was installed, and now, many years later, it was the same color. </p><p> There were vines growing up one side of the house, but not the kind of vines that make a place look quaint and cozy. These were vines that looked as though they were going to engulf the house, eat it raw, digest it, then regurgitate it in the same ghastly green. </p><p> "It can be fixed," Phillip said softly from beside me. </p><p> In the weeks since Jimmie's death, "hell" could not begin to describe what I had been through. </p><p> It was Phillip who woke me in the middle of the night when Jimmie's plane went down. I must say that I was shocked to see him. As Jimmie's wife, I was sacrosanct. The men he surrounded himself with knew what would happen if they made any advances toward me. I don't mean just sexually, but in any other way. No man or woman in Jimmie's employ ever asked me to intercede for him or her with my husband. If he had been fired, he knew that to approach me and ask that I try to "reason" with Jimmie would likely earn him something far worse than a mere dismissal. </p><p> So when I awoke to Jimmie's top lawyer's hand on my shoulder, telling me that I had to get up, I immediately knew what had happened. Only if Jimmie were dead would anyone dare enter my bedroom and think that he'd live to see the dawn. </p><p> "How?" I asked, immediately wide awake and trying to be mature. Inside, I was shaking. Of course it couldn't be true, I told myself. Jimmie was too big, too alive, to be...to be...I couldn't form the word in my mind. </p><p> "You have to get dressed now," Phillip was saying. "We have to keep this secret for as long as we can." </p><p> "Is Jimmie hurt?" I asked, my voice full of hope. Maybe he was in a hospital bed and calling for me. But even as I thought it, I knew it wasn't true. Jimmie knew how I worried about him. "I'd rather have my foot cut off than have to deal with your fretting," he'd said more than once. He hated my nagging about his smoking, about his drinking, about his days without sleep. </p><p> "No," Phillip said, his voice cold and hard. His eyes looked into mine. "James is not alive." </p><p> I wanted to collapse. I wanted to dive back under the warm bedcovers and go back to sleep. And when I awoke again, I wanted Jimmie to be there, slipping his big hand under my nightgown and making those little growling sounds that made me giggle. </p><p> "You don't have time for grief right now," Phillip said. "We have to go shopping." </p><p> That brought me out of my shock. "Are you mad?" I asked him. "It's four o'clock in the morning." </p><p> "I've arranged for a store to open. Now get dressed!" he ordered. "We have no time to lose." </p><p> His tone didn't scare me in the least. I sat down on the bed, my big nightgown billowing out around me, and I pulled my braid out from under me. Jimmie liked for me to wear old-fashioned clothes, and he liked for my hair to be long. After sixteen years of marriage, I could sit on my braid. "I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on." </p><p> "I don't have time now -- " Phillip began, but then he stopped, took a deep breath, and looked at me. "I could be disbarred for this, but I made out James's will, and I know what's coming to you. I can hold off the vultures for a few days but no more. Until the will is read, you're still James's wife." </p><p> "I will always be Jimmie's wife," I said proudly, holding all my chins aloft in the bravest stance I could muster. Jimmie! my heart was crying. Not Jimmie. Anyone on earth could die, but not Jimmie. </p><p> "Lillian," Phillip said softly, his eyes full of pity, "there was only one man like James Manville ever made on this earth. He played by his own rules and no one else's." </p><p> I waited for him to tell me something that I didn't already know. What was he leading up to? </p><p> Phillip ran his hand over his eyes and glanced at the clock on the bed. "By the law of ethics, I can't tell you -- " he began, then he let out his breath and sat down heavily on the bed beside me. If I'd needed any further proof that Jimmie was no longer alive, that would have been it. If there was a chance that Jimmie would walk through the door and see another man sitting on the bed beside his wife, Phillip would never have dared such a familiarity. </p><p> "Who can understand what James did or why? I worked with him for over twenty years, but I never knew him. Lillian, he -- " Phillip had to take a few breaths, then he picked up my hand and held it in his. "He left you nothing. He willed everything to his brother and sister." </p><p> I couldn't understand what he meant. "But he hates them," I said, pulling my hand from his grasp. Atlanta and Ray were Jimmie's only living relatives, and Jimmie despised them. He took care of them financially, always bailing one or the other of them out of some mess, but he detested them. No, worse, he had contempt for them. One time Jimmie was looking at me strangely, and I asked what was going on in his mind. "They'll eat you alive," he said. "That sounds interesting," I replied, smiling at him. But Jimmie didn't smile back. "When I die, Atlanta and Ray will go after you with everything they have. And they'll find lawyers to work on a contingency basis." </p><p> I didn't like what had become Jimmie's frequent references to his demise. "Contingent upon what?" I asked, still smiling. "How much money they get when they sue you to hell and back," Jimmie said, frowning. I didn't want to hear any more, so I waved my hand in dismissal and said, "Phillip will take care of them." "Phillip is no match for greed of that scale." I had no reply for that, because I agreed with him. No matter how much Jimmie gave Atlanta and Ray, they wanted more. One time when Jimmie was called away unexpectedly, I found Atlanta in my closet, counting my shoes. She wasn't the least embarrassed when I found her there. She looked up at me and said, "You have three more pairs than I do." The look on her face frightened me so much that I turned and ran from my own bedroom. </p><p> "What do you mean that he's left it all to them? All what?" I asked Phillip. I wanted to think about anything other than what my life was going to be like without Jimmie. </p><p> "I mean that James willed all his stocks, his houses, real estate around the world, the airlines, all of it to your brother and sister-in-law." </p><p> Since I hated each and every one of the houses that Jimmie had purchased, I couldn't comprehend what was so bad about this. "Too much glass and steel for my taste," I said, giving Phillip a bit of a smile. </p><p> Phillip glared at me. "Lillian, this is <i>serious,</i> and James is no longer here to protect you -- and I don't have the power to do <i>anything.</i> I don't know why he did it, Lord knows I tried to talk him out of it, but he said that he was giving you what you needed. That's all I could get out of him." </p><p> Phillip stood up, then took a moment to regain his calm. Jimmie said that what he liked about Phillip was that nothing on earth could upset him. But this had. </p><p> I tried to get the picture of my future out of my head, tried to stop thinking about a life without Jimmie's laughter and his big shoulders to protect me, and looked up at Phillip expectantly. "Are you saying that I'm destitute?" I tried not to smile. The jewelry that Jimmie had given me over the years was worth millions. </p><p> Phillip took a deep breath. "More or less. He's left you a farm in Virginia." </p><p> "There, then, that's something," I said, then I took the humor out of my voice and waited for him to continue. </p><p> "It was a breach of ethics, but after I wrote the will for him, I sent someone down to Virginia to look at the place. It's...not much. It's -- " He turned away for a moment, and I thought I heard him mutter, "Bastard," but I didn't want to hear that, so I ignored him. When he turned back to me, his face was businesslike. He looked at his watch, a watch that I knew Jimmie had given him; it cost over twenty thousand dollars. I owned a smaller version of it. </p><p> "Did you do anything to him?" Phillip asked sof...</p></p><h2>We Are Not Afraid</h2><p>We Are Not Afraid is the story of the 1964 killing of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in Philadelphia, Mississippi, at the hands of Ku Klux Klansmen and the local cops. Described as &#34;one of the best books on the civil rights movement,&#34; the murders it describes inspired the acclaimed film, Mississippi Burning. The events surrounding this seminal event have re-entered public debate due to the recent conviction of manslaughter by Klansman and Imperial Wizard, Edgar Ray Killen, for his part in orchestrating the murders. As America struggles to honestly confront its history of racism, there has never been a more timely moment to reissue this fully updated edition of We Are Not Afraid. From the roles played by such figures as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy to the remarkable courage of the Freedom Riders, this book relates the definitive story of a nation&#39;s ongoing battle for true democracy.</p><p>PHILIP DRAY is the author of <i>At the Hands of Persons Unknown<i> which won the Robert F.

The drama of the triocollege students Michael Schwerner and Andy Goodman, both white Northerners, and James Chaney, a young black activist from Mississippipits their faith in nonviolence against a murderous rage fueled by racism. Cagin and Dray, who coauthored Hollywood Films of the Seventies, have done their homework: interviews, news reports, FBI documents and trial transcripts undergird their brilliant re-creation of the incident, interwoven with a full-scale history of the civil rights movement. The search for the bodies turned up many black corpses, purported victims of police/Klan violence; the Klan conspirators were paroled before serving their full sentences; in the aftermath, Lyndon Johnson questionably maneuvered to defuse the situation. This is surely one of the best books on the civil rights movement. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Teaching</h2><p>Bringing together three previously unpublished lectures presented to the public by Lacan at the height of his career, and prefaced by Jacques-Alain Miller, <i>My Teaching</i> is a clear, concise introduction to the thought of the influential psychoanalyst after Freud.</p><p>The psychoanalyst <b>Jacques Lacan</b> (1901&#x2013;1981) was one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential thinkers.

As a constant and prodigious collector and patron of young British artists, Charles Saatchi has been unique in his commitment to British art as it is now being produced. His support extends far beyond those such as Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread, whose work has acquired wide notoriety, to dozens of others at the cutting edge of the current art scene. Sensation features the work of forty-two of the most exciting and radical artists working in Britain today. Many of them--such as Jenny Saville, Rachel Whiteread, or Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman--are already internationally acclaimed; others are destined to be. The book's original and penetrating essays include the critical context of their work and trace the phenomenon of the British art scene since "Freeze," the 1988 exhibition that is now recognized as a defining moment in the story of British art. Cutting through tabloid headlines, controversial press coverage, and art-world debate, Sensation reveals the achievements of young British artists and the role played by courageous and imaginative patronage.

She has won the Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize among many others and is a Member of the Royal Society of Literature and the Royal Society of Arts, and an MBE.Employing the same narrative verse style that served her so well in her debut, Lara, British writer Evaristo travels back in time to tell the story of Zuleika, a libidinous but frustrated Sudanese woman who comes of age in a Roman-conquered London in A.D. 211. Spotted at the age of 11 by rich Roman senator Lucius Aurelius Felix, "a man thrice my age and thrice my girth," she lands in the lap of luxury when a wedding quickly takes place. But Felix's lack of libido soon turns the marriage into a prison, and when he begins to travel, jazzy teenager Zuleika hits the social scene in the urban maze that is Londinium and receives some flattering attention from a visiting Roman emperor, Septimus Severus. The two begin a brief but torrid affair until Evaristo wraps up her thin plot by sending Severus off to war as Felix returns to find that the entire community knows about the affair. Plot problems aside, most of this is an excuse for Evaristo to stretch her poetic muscles as she creates a beautiful, passionate African-cum-Roman woman as seen through the imagination of a highly liberated and sexual 21st-century poet. Despite the occasional burst of purple verse, she succeeds admirably in bringing a difficult and treacherous conceit to fruition, liberally indulging in irreverent asides, vivid vernacular speech and clever puns. The generally high quality of the poetry overshadows the failure of the book to develop into a genuine, full-fledged novel. This is a vividly imagined albeit distinctly modern look at a woman's role in Roman times by a talented writer with a fertile mind and a playful spirit. <p></p><p>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>There Is a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem</h2><p>This radical new book from Wayne Dyer proposes that we hold the keys to solving any problems we face within us. He sets out basic principles and foundations we can understand and practice in order to access spiritual solutions to any problems we are experiencing. The book is in two sections. The first sets out the theory, the second enables you to put the wisdom into practice. Part 1. The theory: Everything in the Universe is nothing more than energy. Light and though, spiritual energy, vibrates very quickly. Physical energy, and problem areas, vibrate more slowly. When the highest/fastest frequencies of spirit are brought to the presence of lower/slower frequencies, they nullify and dissipate those things we call problems. We all have the ability to increase our energy and access the highest/fastest energies to eradicate problems in our lives. In carefully structured chapters, Wayne Dyer draws on both ancient wisdom and firsthand accounts, and shows how to: stop giving energy to things you don&#39;t believe in / keep your energy field uncontaminated / raise and maintain your spiritual energy. In the second part of the book, &#34;Putting spiritual problem solving into action&#34;, Dyer shows how we can transform any negative energy into positive energy: hate into love / hurt into forgiveness / doubt into faith / despair into hope / sadness into joy</p><p>With his usual mix of enthusiasm, optimism, and anecdote, Dr. Wayne Dyer is back again to emphasize that we are in control of our life experiences. Quoting everything from the Bible to <i>The Tao of Pooh</i>, he returns continually to his central point: with truth and self-awareness, all things are possible, including physical healing, improved relationships, and great personal accomplishment. <i>There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem</i> dissects what is meant by the word <i>problem</i> and shows us how to achieve our deepest wishes with surprisingly simple suggestions.<p> Illustrating the possibilities with a variety of stories and letters, Dyer manages to nicely balance the whimsical with the practical. On one page, you'll find straightforward advice like, "If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you. Be honest and frank anyway." In the next section, you'll find a long explanation of the importance of finding "the potential to keep your field of energy uncontaminated." Some may find this disconcerting, yet it also allows careful readers to search out the particular story or method that works for them. Anecdotes from addicts, parents whose children have died, and hospital patients are strewn throughout the book, as are references to Dyer's previous works and lengthy passages from other spiritual authors. In every case, these stories showcase the power of positive thinking and using those positive thoughts to manifest positive change. Although this attempt at changing the world one thought at a time is not vastly different in tone or message from Dyer's previous works, his fans will nevertheless appreciate it. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>In this inspiring new book, bestselling author Wayne W. Dyer shows us that there is an omnipresent spiritual force right at our fingertips that contains the solution to our problems -- from ill health to financial worries to relationship difficulties. Drawing from various spiritual traditions, especially from the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi, Dyer helps us unplug from the material world and awaken to the divine within.</p><p>The first part of the book provides the essential foundation for spiritual problem solving. In these chapters, you'll read the words of Patanjali, a Yogi mystic whose teachings and practices deeply affected Dyer and informed his realization that the spiritual force is everywhere.</p><p>The second half, organized around the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi, contains specific suggestions to help readers put spiritual problem solving into practice. Saint Francis's legacy is one of love, harmony, and service -- putting our collective energies toward what we are <em>for</em> instead of what we are against. Each of these last seven chapters begins with a line from this prayer; Dyer then goes on to offer specific and practical suggestions for applying the teaching to everyday problems. These suggestions include affirmations, writing exercises, guided meditations, and other strategies for putting Saint Francis's words and the wisdom of this book into practice.</p><p>Profound and thought provoking, yet filled with pragmatic advice, <em>There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem</em> is a book about self-awareness and tapping the healing energy within all of us. As Dyer writes, "Thinking is the source of problems. Your heart holds the answer to solving them."</p></p><h2>Halo Graphic Novel</h2><p>This graphic novel, based on the best-selling video game, brings the Halo universe to life for the first time in the sequential art medium.</p><p>Based on the wildly popular videogame, this anthology collects four stories by different creators, all set in the Halo universe of the 26th century. The game's central story details a war between Earth's United Nations Space Command and the Covenant, a coalition of hostile alien races. At the center is Master Chief, a UNSC cyborg-marine who discovers the terrible secret of the Halo, a series of ringlike artificial planets. Hardcore Halo fans will love Lee Hammock's "The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor," viscerally illustrated by Simon Bisley, detailing the Flood, a nasty parasitic race of monsters that threaten both the Covenant and the human race. For newcomers there's the legendary Moebius's "Second Sunrise over New Mombasa," in which he renders a beautiful, futuristic version of the Kenyan city&#x2014;and deftly surveys the intersection of war propaganda and the media. The book's artwork is skillful and unusual (including a story by Tsutomu Nihei and a gallery by an all-star lineup of artists in the back) and the writing brings the Halo universe and its central tenets to life. But ultimately the reader will yearn for the depth of a real, book-length graphic novel&#x2014;and maybe that's next to come. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What used to be private is becoming increasingly public. All is aired on talk shows whose guests are no longer celebrities hawking their latest film, book, or album, but ordinary citizens selling their personal traumas. Mothers Who Sleep with Their Daughters' Boyfriends; Men Who Wear Their Girlfriends' Clothes; People Whose Families Have Been Murdered Before Their Eyes--no subject is too salacious or too shameful for public consumption. <p> And now here comes a true story about A Woman Who Slept with Her Father--prime fodder for the TV talk show feeding frenzy. Certainly it would be easy to lump Kathryn Harrison's new memoir, <i>The Kiss</i> into this same category of titillating topics, but that would be a mistake. There is nothing remotely titillating about Harrison's book; instead, it reads like a slow descent into hell--one that compels and repels in almost equal measure at times. Harrison, who did not really meet her father until she was 20, takes the reader on a difficult journey into her loveless childhood, her bouts with anorexia and bulimia, and, eventually, the incestuous 4-year affair with her father. Her prose is deceptively simple; her choice of present tense to describe events that occurred many years ago forces an immediacy--almost a complicity--upon the reader that heightens both revulsion and compassion. </p><p> <i>The Kiss</i> is not for everybody. Some readers will be outraged by its subject matter; others will find it just too painful to read. But for those who make it through, this harrowing tale promises the reward of a life reclaimed and a tragedy transcended.</p>"Only a writer of extraordinary gifts could bring so much light to bear on so dark a matter.

The book of Acts, the divinely inspired history of the early church, is all this and more.</p><p>In the author's words: "One reason I love to study the book of Acts is its uniqueness. It is the sourcebook for the spread of early Christianity. Without it we would know little about the apostolic church except what could be gleaned from Paul's epistles. It is the chronicle of the spreading flame of the Holy Spirit."</p><p>In this welcome addition to the Preaching the Word series, Pastor Kent Hughes explores the key narratives of the book of acts, including the birth of the church, bold gospel preaching resulting in the prospering of the church, and the dramatic missionary journeys of the Apostle Paul.</p></p><p><p><strong>R.

Ages 8-12.</p><p><b>Dave and Neta Jackson</b> are full-time writers and editors whose talented work on the TRAILBLAZER BOOKS has earned them numerous awards and worldwide acclaim. They are the parents of two adult children and make their home in Illinois.Gr. 3^-6. A teenager's struggle to reestablish his trust in God is the focus of this novel, which is set in the early 1500s during the persecution of the Anabaptists (later to become the Mennonites). When his mother is imprisoned for her beliefs, 15-year-old Adriaen wrestles with thoughts of why a just God allows suffering. In trying to find a way to rescue her, he faces the dilemma of whether to betray the leader of the Anabaptists or to embrace a faith that could cost him his own life. The plot is compelling, with the unfolding of events transforming an initially unsympathetic boy into a courageous young man. But the story is most effective in its final scenes, which serve as a catharsis for Adriaen's grief and anger. Having received a letter from his mother encouraging him to follow Christ, Adriaen accepts God's will, fully expecting to witness his mother's execution. <i>Shelly Townsend-Hudson</i></p><h2>At the Lord&#39;s Table: A Communion Book Using the Holy Eucharist, Rite Two from the Book of Common Prayer According to the Use of the Episcopal Church</h2><p>Illustrations and text present the communion service of the Episcopal Church.</p><p></p><h2>Marilu Henner&#39;s Total Health Makeover: Ten Steps to Your BEST Body</h2><p><blockquote>"The question I've been asked most often over the last ten years is 'Marilu, why is it that you are much thinner now and even younger looking than you were when you did <em>Taxi</em> in the 70s?'

She waffled between starving herself and gorging herself. Since cutting dairy products and caffeine out of her diet, adopting a food-combining plan, and following a program that's code-named "BEST"--for balance, energy, stamina, and toxin-free--she's shaved nearly 100 points off her cholesterol count and 50 pounds off her frame, and she looks younger at 45 than she did at 19. If you don't count her pregnancies, her weight hasn't changed by more than 5 pounds over the past 11 years. <p> Henner's 10-step health program outlined here is strict, but she offers tips for getting your feet wet. Start by cutting out caffeine one day a week, she advises, instead of going cold turkey, and make just one meal each day dairy-free, so the change doesn't come as a shock to your system. Her "anti-milk manifesto," which reveals exactly how milk is produced and how it negatively affects the human body, is quite a stunner. Her plan offers sound advice for becoming more mindful of how you treat your body, how and what you eat and why, and how you react to stress, along with how to make improvements in all these areas. Henner's especially trustworthy because she's been through the wringer: "After nineteen years of experimenting, a thousand mistakes, over 400 books (read, not written), at least 200 bad diets over my lifetime, five doctors, two physical therapists, three nutritionists, two personal trainers, one therapist, and a partridge in a pear tree, I have found what I believe are the best answers this planet has to offer about living a healthy, happy, and balanced life." And she holds nothing back as she passes on her hard-earned knowledge about nutrition, digestion, exercise, preventive medicine, detoxification, and stress reduction.</p><p>Marilu Henner is well known for her roles in <em>Taxi</em> and <em>Evening Shade</em> and her participation in <em>The Celebrity Apprentice</em>.

This selection of Chomsky's essays and lectures comes divided into geographical areas, but the issues are global in scope and import. In dissecting the rhetoric and logic of American empire and class domination, at home and abroad, Chomsky continues a longstanding and crucial work of elucidation and activism. His latest updates elaborate upon his signature themes&#x2014;the double standards applied by the centers of U.S. power, including the mainstream media and intellectual culture, and the pervasive disconnect between American policies and public opinion in what Chomsky dubs a dysfunctional democracy. But this book flags another major interest of Chomsky's, signaled in the title: global avenues of resistance, in particular the democratic and independent course being forged across Latin America (where several of these lectures were originally delivered). There are significant redundancies and polemical flourishes, but the writing remains unswervingly rational and principled throughout, and lends bracing impetus to the real alternatives before us. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Emphasized are his periods of engagement with the birth of photojournalism in the 1930s; with humanist social realism in the 1940s and 1950s; and with montage and art brut in the 1960s. The photographs, made by Doisneau on his own and while working for Vogue, Life, and other well-known magazines, reveal how the familiar is swept away, a theme germane to city-dwellers everywhere.</p><p><i>Robert Doisneau: A Photographer's Life</i> covers the renowned work of the French photographer famous for the 1950 picture <i>Le Baiser de le Hotel de Ville</i>. This frequently reproduced portrait of an attractive couple frozen in an embrace while Parisian city life whirls around them is an archetypal emblem of romance. It's pretty surprising to learn that Doisneau hired young actors for his entire kissing series; nevertheless, the moment rings undeniably true. Maybe it's his beginnings in advertising or his fashion work for <i>Vogue</i> that lend his images equal parts of real life and theater. <p> Doisneau (1912-1994) spent his lifetime recording life in France. With his combination of photojournalism and art, he captured nightclubs, the Parisian working-class suburbs, national monuments, weddings, and famous folk like Picasso. Some of the most riveting pictures are of resistance fighters in the midst of the Occupation--young men in civilian clothes, sportcoats and all, standing with guns behind homemade barricades. Accompanying the hundreds of pictures are in-depth chapters that discuss the different periods in Doisneau's life and work. From his childhood, through the war, and on to his fascination with the <i>banlieues</i> (suburbs), the well-researched text gives invaluable insight into this influential photographer's practice. <i>--J.P.Cohen</i></p>The definitive volume on the life and work of Robert Doisneau, the French photographer who captured the mood and character of Paris as the city entered the modern age.</p><h2>Odyssey 1: Odyssey 1 (Magic: The Gathering S.)</h2><p>Champions from each of the five schools of magic compete for the ultimate prize, the &#34;Mirror of Desires,&#34; a mysterious artifact that holds the key to preserving the tenuous balance of power between the five schools.

Well&#39;s haunting visionary fable. The book created a sensation when it first appeared in 1896, and Wells himself later deemed the work &#34;an exercise in youthful blasphemy.&#34; The new The Island of Dr. Moreau feature film stars Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer.</p><p>A shipwreck in the South Seas, a palm-tree paradise where a mad doctor conducts vile experiments, animals that become human and then "beastly" in ways they never were before--it's the stuff of high adventure. It's also a parable about Darwinian theory, a social satire in the vein of Jonathan Swift (<i>Gulliver's Travels</i>), and a bloody tale of horror. Or, as H. G. Wells himself wrote about this story, "<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> is an exercise in youthful blasphemy. Now and then, though I rarely admit it, the universe projects itself towards me in a hideous grimace. It grimaced that time, and I did my best to express my vision of the aimless torture in creation." This colorful tale by the author of <i>The Time Machine</i>, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> lit a firestorm of controversy at the time of its publication in 1896.Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

Gunfire cracked past. Inside the ruins, several young infantrymen from Kilo Company, Third Battalion, Sixth Marines, crouched near the bodies of freshly killed civilians. They had tallied eleven corpses so far. All but two were women or children.<br> <br>Two American rockets had struck here a short while before, a pair of errant blows in a battle between the Marines and the Taliban that had begun in the morning of Valentine&#x2019;s Day. In the seconds after, as a dusty smoke cloud rose, a small girl scrambled out. For a moment she stood still. Then she ran, sprinting headlong to another nearby building, which the Americans occupied as a temporary outpost. Her father was detained inside.<br> <br>Soon Marines were hustling across the field, crossing the open space where a gunfight had raged for hours. When they entered they found one more survivor&#x2014;a young woman lying in a pool of blood. She was calling out children&#x2019;s names. The blasts had severed both her legs and one of her arms. Covered with dirt, streaked with blood, she moaned and repeatedly asked for the kids. She tried sitting up. A corpsman and a few Marines consoled her. A lieutenant and a sergeant with radios called their commanding officer, seeking a Black Hawk medevac aircraft to rush the woman to care. Around her the bodies of her family were scattered where they had died, not far from dead poultry and sheep. Gently the Marines assured the dying woman that all would be okay.<br> <br>The Pentagon and the manufacturer of the weapon that struck here, known as a HIMARS,I consider its ordnance to be precise. Its GPS sensors and guidance system help the rockets fly scores of miles and slam to earth within feet of the coordinates they are programmed to hit. Each carries a high-explosive warhead and a fuze that can be set to burst in the air, maximizing the spread of shrapnel below. The manufacturer markets them as &#x201c;low collateral damage&#x201d; weapons. This is true on practice ranges. Battlefields rarely resemble ranges. More often they are the lands where people live and work, and in this profoundly poor village, the Pentagon&#x2019;s precision weapons had hit precisely the wrong place. A sniper had been firing on the Marines from near another home, but the rockets landed here. A family following American instructions&#x2014;stay inside and out of the way&#x2014;had been almost instantly destroyed.<br> <br>By the time the Black Hawk arrived, the woman had died.<br> <br>The aircraft flew into a trap.<br> <br>Automatic fire erupted. Kalashnikov rifles joined in. The Taliban had been waiting, and ambushed the aircraft as its wheels settled toward the ground. The lieutenant and sergeant ran into view, arms waving, warding the pilots off. Their company commander shouted to a radio operator: &#x201c;Abort! Abort! Tell him to abort!&#x201d;<br> <br>The helicopter lurched forward, gathering speed. A rocket-propelled grenade whooshed into the whirling tower of dust. An explosion boomed behind the Black Hawk&#x2019;s tail rotor&#x2014;a near miss. The helicopter flew across the field, banked, and put down near the company commander to pick up a wounded Marine, whom the sniper had shot. Then it was gone.<br> <br>A lull replaced the din. Young men muttered curses. Inside the compound, Afghan soldiers working with the Marines covered the dead with cloth. A Taliban commander, overheard on his own radio frequency, berated his fighters in Pashto for missing the Black Hawk. He&#x2019;d almost realized his prize. &#x201c;That was your chance!&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>These Marines were almost all young men on their first enlistments, the type of citizen who serves for four years and returns to civilian life. They were thoroughly trained, visibly fit, thoughtfully equipped, and generally eager to participate in what they were told would be a historic fight, a campaign preordained for American military lore. Most of them were also so new to war that the dead women and children were the first casualties they had seen. Many of them wanted then, and still want now, to connect their battlefield service to something greater than a memory reel of gunfights, explosions, and grievous wounds. They wanted to understand accidental killings as isolated mistakes in a campaign characterized by sound strategy, moral authority, and lasting success. They didn&#x2019;t get this, at least not all of it. Instead, the major general commanding NATO forces in southern Afghanistan circulated a publicly palatable version. The HIMARS rockets, he said, hit the correct building after all. For years the Marine Corps and the Pentagon said little more, even as Marja, seized by Marines and then held by their Afghan army and police partners, returned to Taliban and drug-baron control.<br> <br>This book is about men and women who served in American combat service in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It covers these combatants with a simple organizing idea: that they are human. It details personal experiences: what these experiences were, how they unfolded, and what effects they had upon those who were there. And it covers them from their own perspectives, offering their own interpretations of their wars.<br> <br>More than 2.7 million Americans have served in Afghanistan or Iraq since late 2001. Many went to both wars. Nearly 7,000 of them died, and tens of thousands more were wounded. President Donald Trump&#x2019;s chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General John F. Kelly, who lost a son in combat in Afghanistan and under whom I briefly served three decades ago when he led the course that trains new Marine infantry officers, called these men and women &#x201c;the best 1 percent this country produces.&#x201d; He added: &#x201c;Most of you, as Americans, don&#x2019;t know them. Many of you don&#x2019;t know anyone who knows any one of them.&#x201d; This book is an effort to remedy that, in part through demystification. In doing so, it also rejects many senior officer views. It channels those who did the bulk of the fighting with the unapologetic belief that the voices of combatants of the lower and middle rank are more valuable, and more likely to be candid and rooted in battlefield experience, than those of the generals and admirals who order them to action&#x2014;and often try to speak for them, too.<br> <br>No single military unit or individual character can capture the breadth of the national projects the wars became. But the cross section of characters who follow represents the experiences of a significant portion. Many of them served in the infantry or the Special Forces or performed jobs&#x2014;as a strike fighter or scout-helicopter pilot, or as a corpsman&#x2014;that were closely connected with infantry life. These men and women volunteered, uttered their oaths, and entrusted themselves to politicians and officers who would decide where, when, and why they would go. Some had brief enlistments. They felt compelled to serve for part of their youth. Others chose full careers, embarked upon multiple combat deployments, and stayed beyond twenty years, returning to the wars with tiring bodies and graying hair. All of them had personally grueling wartime experiences. Most of them suffered wounds&#x2014;physical, psychological, moral, or all three. Together, their journeys hold part of the sum of American foreign policy in our time.<br> <br>Stripped down, such journeys also hold something else: the recognition that for many combatants the wars were for a time reduced to something local and immediate, little more than who was near and whatever happened. This human experience of combat is often unexpressed by the public relations specialists and senior officers who try to explain the purposes of operations rather than describe the experience of them, and who together drive an outsized share of the discourse of American wars in real time. The pages that follow offer personal experiences over official narratives and slogans. They are a presentation of what results when ideas about warfighting, some of them flawed, become orders.<br> <br>Grunts, as members of the infantry call themselves with grim pride, live beyond the end of the road. They do not make policy. They are stuck in it, which is to say that they are the inheritors of the problems caused by the ambitions, poor judgments, and mistakes of others, starting with their politicians and generals and continuing down the line. They have jobs that are almost impossible to do perfectly, much less perfectly all the time. Even when they mean well, they are often attacked with as much ferocity and thwarted with as much cunning as when they intend to do harm. Often they are punished simply for being present, set upon for the offense of being there.<br> <br>On one matter there can be no argument. The foreign policies that sent these men and women abroad, with an emphasis on military activity and visions of reordering foreign nations and cultures, did not succeed. It is beyond honest dispute that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq failed to achieve what their organizers promised, no matter the party in power or the officers in command. Astonishingly expensive, operationally incoherent, sold by a shifting slate of senior officers and politicians and editorial-page hawks, the wars continued in varied forms each and every year after the first passenger jet struck the World Trade Center in 2001. They continue today without a satisfying end in sight.<br> <br>As the costs grew&#x2014;whether measured by dollars spent, stature lost, or blood shed&#x2014;the wars&#x2019; organizers and the commentators supporting them were ready with optimistic predictions. According to the bullhorns and depending on the year, America&#x2019;s military campaigns would satisfy justice, displace tyrants, spread democracy, prevent sectarian war, reduce corruption, bolster women&#x2019;s rights, decrease the international heroin trade, check the influence of extreme religious ideology, create Iraqi and Afghan security forces that would be law-abiding and competent, and finally build nations that might peacefully stand on their own in a global world, all while discouraging other would-be despots and terrorists with evil designs.<br> <br>Little of this turned out as briefed. Aside from displacing tyrants and the eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, prominent successes were short-lived. New thugs rose where old thugs fell. New enemies emerged or multiplied, including the Islamic State. Corruption and lawlessness remain entrenched. An uncountable tally of innocent people&#x2014;many times the number of those who perished in the terrorist attacks in Washington, Pennsylvania, and New York&#x2014;were killed. Many more were wounded or driven from their homes, first by American action and then by violent social forces that American action helped unleash. The scale of waste was almost immeasurable. Much of the infrastructure the United States built with its citizens&#x2019; treasure and its troops&#x2019; labor lies abandoned. Briefly schools or outposts, many structures are now husks, nothing but looted and desolate monuments to forgotten plans. Hundreds of thousands of weapons provided to would-be allies have vanished; an uncountable number are on markets or in the hands of enemies. The billions of dollars spent creating security partners also deputized pedophiles, torturers, and thieves. National police or army units the Pentagon touted as essential to their countries&#x2019; futures have disbanded, ceding their equipment as they disappeared. The governments of Afghanistan and Iraq, which the United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to build and support, are fragile and willing to align with Washington&#x2019;s competitors or foes. The nations they struggle to rule harbor large contingents of irregular fighters and terrorists who have grown savvy through the experience of fighting the American military machine. The Pentagon specializes in war. Across three presidential administrations, with a license to spend and experiment unmatched by any nation on earth, it managed, again and again, to make war look like a bad idea.<br> <br>More than a decade and a half after the White House insisted that American troops would be welcomed as liberators, large swaths of territory in both nations are so hostile to the United States that they are no-go zones, regions into which almost no Americans dare to tread, save a few journalists and aid workers, or private contractors or American military and CIA teams. The American fighters who do venture into the badlands operate within a dilemma. Their presence is fuel for insurgency and yet their absence can create sanctuaries for extremists to organize and grow.<br> <br>Such are the legacies of the American campaigns.<br> <br>To understand some of what is portrayed in the pages that follow, two elements of these campaigns demand forthright explanation here: the relations between American combat units and civilians where they operated, and the struggles of Afghanistan&#x2019;s and Iraq&#x2019;s security forces.<br> <br>One of the many sorrows of the wars is that most American troops had little substantive interaction with Afghan and Iraqi civilians. Language and cultural differences, tactics, rules, security barriers, operational tempo, violence, racism, mutual suspicions, and a dearth of interpreters all combined to prevent it. The people who lived where Americans fought and patrolled, and whose protection was presented in official statements as one of the wars&#x2019; organizing ideas, often were regarded by those on duty in the provinces as scenery, puzzles, problems, or worse. Citizens and occupiers had physical proximity but almost total social distance. Special Forces units, depending on how they were used, could be an exception but often were not. The result was that during action, and after, American combatants had little means to gain insight into the views or experiences of Afghan and Iraqi civilians, as is often evident in veterans&#x2019; memories and accounts of their tours.<br> <br>As for the Afghans and Iraqis that American forces did interact closely with&#x2014;members of Afghanistan&#x2019;s and Iraq&#x2019;s security forces&#x2014;many American troops, including many in this book, formed harsh views. These views were true to their time. They reflected particular circumstances during the occupations and relations more generally between American and local partner forces among the conventional rank and file. But they should not be read as an indictment of Afghan and Iraqi troops overall, especially during the most ambitious years of these forces&#x2019; expansion. This is because the conventional national forces of Afghanistan and Iraq&#x2014;as organized and provided for by American generals&#x2014;were poorly matched for operations alongside American units. In retrospect, they were built almost perfectly to fail.<br> <br>The design flaws were many. From the outset, Afghan and Iraqi volunteers were issued less capable weapons and vehicles, and fewer items of protective equipment, than their American partners. Their training was rudimentary and hurried, and opportunities for improvement via battlefield experience were undercut by competing American ambitions. (As local units became seasoned, and capable noncommissioned officers emerged, many of these promising Afghan and Iraqi veterans were offered jobs to work with American special operations forces, depriving line units of competent people.) Limited vetting of applicants ensured that the local ranks were infiltrated by collaborators and spies.

Garrison Keillor's holiday farce is the perfect gift for the millions of fans who tune into <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> every week.</p></p><p><b>Garrison Keillor</b> was born in Anoka, Minnesota, and graduated from the University of Minnesota-one more English major. The writer and host of <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i>, he is also the author of the bestselling Lake Wobegon novels. He lives in St. Paul, Minnesota, and New York City.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by by Kristi Lanier Garrison Keillor's A Christmas Blizzard (Viking, $21.95) has clear parallels to Dickens's "A Christmas Carol" -- except it's nuttier. Phobia-ridden tycoon James Sparrow thumbs a big "bah humbug" at Christmas and has one foot out the door to Hawaii even though his holiday-loving wife is prostrate with the flu. But news that his favorite uncle is on his deathbed diverts Sparrow to his North Dakota home town. When a blizzard strands him, Sparrow finds himself overnighting in a fishing shack, entertaining visions and relatives who propel him toward happiness. In this manic lead-up to Christmas Eve, Keillor exhibits his brilliance for drawing spot-on caricatures. A favorite uncle also factors in the plot of Anne Perry's A Christmas Promise (Ballantine, $18). But so does exhaustion. With the seventh novel in her Christmas-themed whodunits, the reliable mystery writer seems tired. Gracie Phipps's compassion entangles her in a mystery when she agrees to help young Minnie Maude search for her dead uncle's donkey. What looks like a simple cart accident and donkey heist turns sinister when news surfaces that Uncle Alf, a rag-and-bone man, picked up a golden box on his route. Despite its engrossing depiction of Victorian England, this Christmas tale gets bogged down by wooden characters and too little surprise. The unflappable English barrister Horace Rumpole tussles with crime in A Rumpole Christmas, a charming collection of previously published stories by John Mortimer, who died earlier this year. Of course, spine-tingling plots were never Mortimer's game; crime-solving is what happens while Rumpole is being Rumpole -- eating, sparring with colleagues and doing the bidding of his wife, Hilda (She Who Must Be Obeyed). Whether he's drinking yak's milk on a health farm and foiling a false accusation or tricking an ex-con into philanthropy, these cases simply melt in the warm glow that is Rumpole. Hans Christian Andersen's haunting "The Little Match Girl" is almost sirenlike. Writers and directors have tried repeatedly to touch its diaphanous sorrow. Gregory Maguire is the latest to succumb with his new little book, Matchless, originally written for NPR. Maguire wraps the girl's story within the tale of Frederik and his mother, who live in a cold northern country where she works as a seamstress and he startles fish from the mouths of seagulls. Unbeknown to his mother, Frederik is building a secret world in the attic from bits of trash. On one scavenging trip, he enters the little match girl's story as the boy who retrieves one of her lost slippers. Maguire's intent is pure as he tries to turn the original story's sadness to a happier ending. But some tales need no embellishment. Frederik and his mother intrude on the transcendent wholeness of "The Little Match Girl," while the match girl distracts from a new fairy tale that could have stood on its own. Narrator Felix Funicello calls Wishin' and Hopin' (Harper, $19.99) his "act of contrition" for schoolboy transgressions. But in the hands of Wally Lamb, what emerges isn't an apology but a celebration of life -- flawed, goofy, wonderful life. Set in a small-town Catholic school in 1964, the tale follows Felix and his fifth-grade classmates as they study each other, their tight-sweatered new teacher and an ebullient Russian transfer student, right up to an outrageous Christmas pageant finale. Throughout, Felix teeters between adolescence and adulthood. Still innocent enough not to understand dirty jokes but old enough to know they're dirty, Felix makes a hilarious guide through a story that whirs right along. Celebrity pastor T.D. Jakes has built an empire on his Bible teachings, and in his latest novel, The Memory Quilt (Atria, $19.99), he stitches the story of the Virgin Mary into a modern-day tale that's inspiring and warmhearted. Widow Lela Edwards considers her plain-spoken style a virtue. But her children aren't coming home for Christmas, and she's spending her days in her deteriorating neighborhood crabbing at the neighbors. When Lela's Bible study group starts on the story of Mary, she begins to see parallels in her own life and feels compelled to resume work on a neglected quilting project. While Jakes tries valiantly to give the quilt significance, it mostly serves as a reason for Lela to sit and listen to Bible CDs. He tosses in a bit of mystery, too. But sharp, sassy Lela is the real draw here. And as she stumbles and rights herself, Jakes achieves his purpose: teaching the Bible, gently. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.
